# Adapt Product Quizzes for Different Markets and Languages

When a shopper lands on your store, they instantly notice two things:  

*Does this feel made for me?* and *Can I trust it?*  

![adapt quizzes to markets image1](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Quizzes-for-markets.png)

If your quiz greets a French customer in English, shows dollars instead of euros, or asks questions that feel out of place in their culture, you lose that moment of connection.  

Adapting your quizzes for different markets and languages is not just a technical detail — it’s a way of saying **you belong here**.

---

## The Case for Localization

Think of your quiz as a digital salesperson.  
A good salesperson doesn’t speak the same script to everyone — they adapt depending on who’s in front of them.

- In Spain, friendliness and warmth can make people more comfortable sharing information.  
- In Germany, clarity and compliance cues (like showing “per 100ml” pricing) reassure customers that your brand is professional.  

    !!! tip "Tip: Product Metafields"
    
        To show the “grundpreis” or `per 100ml` price for cosmetic products RevenueHunt app allows you to show these values by automatically [syncing the metafields/attributes](/how-to-guides/add-product-metafields/) of products from your store.

- In the US, speed and incentives (“Take this 45-second quiz for 10% off”) tend to drive engagement.

The same quiz, copied and pasted across all markets, misses those nuances. A localized quiz, on the other hand, feels natural — and customers reward that effort with higher engagement and stronger conversions.


!!! info "Shopify Markets Support"

    The `💎 Built for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app fully supports the Shopify Markets feature allowing you to assign quizzes to different markets and languages quickly and easily.

    Check our step by step tutorial on how to set up Shopify Markets and assign quizzes to different markets and languages with the RevenueHunt app: [Assign Quizzes to Shopify Markets and Languages](/tutorials/shopify-markets/).

## What Changes When You Localize

Localization isn’t just swapping languages. It touches multiple layers of the experience:

**Language and tone.** A casual “Hey, let’s find your skincare match” might resonate in the US, while a more polished tone may feel appropriate in Japan.  

**Visuals.** Even colors carry meaning. Red signals good fortune in China but can imply danger in Western markets.  

**Currency and pricing.** Showing euros to a German customer instead of USD removes an instant layer of friction.  

**Legal requirements.** Some regions enforce very specific rules — like GDPR consent in Europe or advertising standards in Canada.  

Together, these details tell your customers: *we understand you, and we built this experience for you*.

---

## The Business Payoff

Brands that localize their quizzes consistently see three wins:

1. **More completed quizzes.** People stick with what feels familiar and relevant.  
2. **Higher conversions.** Clear pricing and tailored recommendations reduce hesitation.  
3. **Deeper customer loyalty.** When someone feels seen, they’re far more likely to come back.

And there’s a side benefit: you gather **better data**. Localized quizzes reveal what customers in France care about versus what drives decisions in Australia. That’s market research you can act on.

---

## Tips for a Smooth Rollout

!!! tip "Check our tutorial"

    If you want the technical “how-to” on assigning quizzes to Shopify Markets, we’ve got you covered here:  
    👉 [Tutorial: Assign Quizzes to Shopify Markets and Languages](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/tutorials/shopify-markets/)

Start small. Choose your top two or three markets, duplicate your best-performing quiz, and adapt it. Don’t try to cover the globe in one sprint.  

Keep branding consistent. Customers should recognize your brand instantly, even if the tone shifts slightly to match local expectations.  

Test in the wild. The in-app preview won’t show market differences, so you’ll need to publish and actually change your store region or language to see what customers see.  

Plan for upkeep. Quizzes aren’t “set and forget.” Product lines evolve, translations need polishing, and regulations shift. Build localization into your ongoing operations, not as a one-off project.

---

A localized quiz does more than recommend products. It builds trust across borders, increases conversions, and turns your store into a brand that feels truly global.  

But remember: the real success lies not in the setup, but in the mindset.   Localization is the difference between saying *we sell everywhere* and *we care everywhere*.

# Smart Ways to Ask for Marketing/Data Processing Consent in the Quiz

Marketing and data processing is crucial for building trust and ensuring compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA. For ecommerce platforms, especially those in the beauty sector, product recommendation quizzes offer a unique and engaging way to collect valuable customer data. However, asking for consent must be done thoughtfully to avoid deterring users.

Here are smart, user-friendly strategies to ask for marketing and data processing consent in your RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz.

## First Consider **When** to Ask
The best way to ask for email/phone marketing consent is to make it a natural part of the quiz flow. Instead of presenting it as a standalone request, weave it into the narrative of the quiz. There are two approaches on when to ask for marketing consent and both will affect your quizzes drop-off rate/ completion rate:

### 👋 Before the Quiz Begins

Start with a friendly welcome message that explains the benefits of taking the quiz. Mention that by providing consent, users will receive personalized recommendations and exclusive offers.

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent before the quiz begins](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent-start-quiz-1024x732.png)


Asking for consent before the quiz starts will lead to **lower quiz completions** and higher drop off at the beginning but will provide **more quality leads** and filter clients genuenly interested in your products. This approach is better for merchants selling unique and luxury items.

### 🖐️ At the End

At a strategic point, such as before showing the results, include a consent request. Make it part of a question about communication preferences. This creates a sunk-time-cost fallaciy in the mind of the customer and they are more likely to leave their data just to see the results.

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent at the end](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent-end-quiz-e1718952561212-1024x702.png)

Asking for consent at the end of the quiz will lead to a **lower drop-off** at this point since the customer is already invested in the experience. This will lead to higher completion rates and eventually **higher conversions** and upselling success. This approach is better for merchants selling inexpensive items or routines.

It is not recommended to ask for email or marketing data mid-way through the quiz as this only increases your quiz drop-off rate.

## Next, if it should be **Optional** or **Mandatory**

Whether you make your email/phone number question mandatory or optional will also have a huge impact on your quiz drop-off and conversion rate.

### ⛔ Mandatory

Making the email/phone consent question mandatory ensures that you collect contact information from every user who completes the quiz. This can be beneficial for building a robust email list quickly. However, it may also deter some users from completing the quiz if they are not comfortable sharing their information.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Ensures a high volume of data collection | May increase quiz drop-off rates. May include many fake emails. |
| Filters out less engaged users, potentially leading to higher-quality leads | Some users may find it intrusive and opt-out early |


### ✅ Optional

Making the email/phone consent question optional can create a more user-friendly experience, encouraging more users to complete the quiz. This approach respects user privacy and autonomy, potentially leading to higher overall quiz engagement.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Higher quiz completion rates | Lower volume of data collection |
| Users feel less pressured, leading to a more positive brand experience | May require additional incentives to encourage users to opt-in |

!!! tip "Tip: Make Question Optional"

    In RevenueHunt app you can choose if a quiz question should be mandatory or optional in [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).


## Then **How** to Ask for Marketing Consent

Clear and honest communication is key to gaining trust when asking for marketing consent. Here’s how to do it effectively:

###1️⃣ Use Transparent Wording

**Simplify your message** to avoid legal jargon and make it easy to understand. **Highlight the benefits** users gain by consenting, such as exclusive content, discounts, or early access to new products. Usually, Yes/No questions are straightforward and reduce friction in the consent process. Ask direct yes/no questions regarding consent to make it easy for users to make a choice..

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent friendly and transparent wording](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent-simple-language1.png)

!!! tip "Tip: Use a GDPR/Question"
    Use a GDPR/Yes-No Question type to easily ask for consent in RevenueHunt app.

**Example**: “We’d love to stay in touch to share the best skincare tips and product updates. Do we have your permission to send you emails?” or “Get the most out of our recommendations! Sign up for our newsletter to receive special offers and expert skincare advice.” or “Do you agree to receive our personalized product recommendations and updates? [ ] Yes [ ] No”.


### 2️⃣ Add Link to Privacy Policy

Make your Privacy Policy easily accessible to add transparency and reassure users about how their data will be handled.
 
![smart ways to ask for marketing consent add a link to your privacy policy](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-14-122634-1536x621.png)

**Example**: “By providing your email address you agree to our [privacy policy](https://www.linktoyourprivacypolicy.com).”
    
!!! tip "Tip: Link from any text element"
    You can link to your Privacy Policy within any text element of the RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz.


!!! tip "Tip: Marketing Checkmark"
    Follow [these instructions](/how-to-guides/ask-for-marketing-consent/#option-2-marketing-checkmark) to add a marketing checkmark to any quiz slide.

### 3️⃣ Design Choices Matter

The design and placement of consent requests can significantly impact user engagement.

**Use visual cues** like checkboxes or toggle switches for consent options. You can also use **clickable icons** instead of checkboxes or use buttons that change color or animate when clicked.

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent design choices matter](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent1.gif)

Ensure these options are accessible on all devices with large clickable areas for mobile users. Position consent requests at engaging points in the quiz to avoid disrupting the flow.

!!! tip "Tip: Use Picture Questions"
    Use [Picture Questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-types) to add animated gifs to your quiz choices in RevenueHunt app.

**Example**: “Want to receive our updates? Click the heart to say yes! ❤️” or “Would you like to receive our updates? [ ] Yes, absolutely! (Enthusiastic yes gif) [ ] No, thanks. (Button shakes slightly)”.

### 4️⃣ Offer a Clear Opt-Out Option

Respecting user choice is essential. Always provide a clear and **easy way for users to opt-out of marketing communications. Reassure users they can still complete the quiz and receive recommendations even if they choose not to opt-in.

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent offer a clear opt-out option](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent-opt-out-hearts.png)

!!! tip "Tip: Question Description"
    You can add additional information to each quiz slide by activating a [question description](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings) or adding an extra text block in RevenueHunt app.

**Example**: “You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in our emails. You can still get your personalized recommendations without signing up for our newsletter.”

### 5️⃣ Reward System

Offer immediate rewards or incentives for giving consent, such as a **discount code** or a free sample.

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent reward system](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent-discount3.png)


!!! tip "Tip: Add Discount"
    Check [this guide](/how-to-guides/add-discount/) to learn how to offer discounts in your RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz.

**Example**: “Get 10% off your next purchase! Do you agree to receive our exclusive offers? [ ] Yes, I love discounts! [ ] No, I’m good for now.”

### 6️⃣ Build Trust with Transparency

Being transparent about how you will use the data builds trust and increases the likelihood of obtaining consent. Briefly explain why you need the data and how it will benefit the user. Reassure users that **their data will be handled securely** and respectfully.

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent build trust with transparency](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent-discount.png)

**Example**: “We use your data to provide personalized skincare recommendations and to keep you updated with the latest offers. We respect your privacy and will never share your data with third parties.”

---

Obtaining consent for marketing and data processing in product recommendation quizzes doesn’t have to be a daunting task. By integrating consent requests into the quiz, using friendly and transparent wording, making smart design choices, offering clear opt-out options, and building trust through transparency, you can improve the user experience while ensuring compliance and building a strong relationship with your customers.

This article explains how to ask for marketing consent in your RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz.

# How to build a Sales Funnel

*(that will convert customers on autopilot)*

The key to any successful eCommerce business is a healthy sales funnel. This is especially true for stores whose survival relies on transforming their site visitors from casual browsers into committed customers.

Over the past few years, eCommerce sales funnels have emerged as one of the fastest ways to get more sales, increase `Average Order Value` and sell more products to every visitor.

![sales funnel](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shopify-sales-funnel-simplified.png)

You’ve probably seen the above visual representation of an eCommerce sales funnel a thousand times. Marketers use them all the time. As you get closer to a sale, the number of people that go to the next step decreases.

!!! info "Main advantages of having a sales funnel are:"

    – **Increased sales through better targeting**. Sales funnels advise customers on finding the right products for them and help them make confident purchasing decisions.

    – **Getting to know your customers**. During different steps of the funnel, you’ll have the chance to collect actionable data about your customers and define your buyer personas, while considering demographics, customer motivation, behavior patterns, and goals. This information will help you when retargeting customers with segmented marketing campaigns.

    – **Building long term relationships with your audience**. Only 2% of shoppers typically convert on their first visit to an eCommerce store. However, with the right incentives, it’s easy to capture new visitors’ emails. This way you can start building a relationship with them and you can close more sales further down the road.

The process of creating a sales funnel has come a long way, too. Building a sales funnel used to take weeks, require tons of custom coding, and a whole team of developers. These days, **thanks to a few apps**, it’s now possible to have it **up and running in a few hours**.

A well-built sales funnel can be a powerful foundation to build your eCommerce business on. Unfortunately, the out-of-the-box solution doesn’t come with many common sales funnel features, like conversion quizzes, one-click upsells, order bumps, and even custom sales pages. However, there are many upsell apps available that help to boost conversion rate and increase revenue with different selling strategies.

!!! note "RevenueHunt"

    [RevenueHunt](https://revenuehunt.com) specializes in building sales funnels for established eCommerce businesses. As a Shopify Partner we focus on working specifically with Shopify stores. We’re specialists in creating funnels designed both to grow your email list and to drive your sales.

In this article I’m going to show you how to build a sales funnel that works seamlessly on Shopify to boost conversions for your eCommerce store. I’ll show you exactly which apps to use, how to connect them and I’ll share tips to make sure your funnel pages convert.


## What's an eCommerce Sales Funnel?

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty details of how to build a sales funnel for your eCommerce store, let’s get on the same page of exactly what a sales funnel is.

A sales funnel takes someone from being a visitor (someone who might have just found your brand through Social Media) and moves them through the buyer’s journey to become a customer. **It’s conformed by a number of steps designed to guide shoppers toward a buying decision**.** These steps include marketing assets that actually do the selling for you (eg. quizzes, emails and landing pages).

!!! tip "No sales funnel, no sales"

    Not having a sales funnel and driving paid traffic to your store is like approaching a complete stranger in the street and pitching them a $149 product. No way! 

Now, imagine entering a store and finding a friendly expert staff member who welcomes you and **helps you find exactly what you’re looking for**. Not only that, but they also share current promotions and sales, discuss complementary items and walk you through the checkout process.

That’s the effect a well-constructed sales funnel can have on your eCommerce store: **recreating the “personal shopper” experience** for your online customers. The goal is to seamlessly guide customers through the entire buying process, from the moment they find out about your brand to buying your products.

!!! example "The Shopify Sales Funnel Template"

    ![sales funnel template](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shopify-sales-funnel-diagram.png)

    The above diagram is a summary of the blueprint we use to build sales funnels for our Shopify clients. We’ll analyze each step in the funnel and I’ll show you which apps to use in each step.


## Step 1: Turn visitors into Subscribers 

*(with a Conversion Quiz)*

Our main goal in this step is to **get your visitors’ email before we send them to our first sales funnel**. It’s of great importance to get this first step right because the effectiveness of the rest of the steps will depend on it.

The easiest way to do this is with a conversion quiz created with the RevenueHunt app.

Not only will you offer your customers a personalized product recommendation, you’ll also be able to **segment your customers based on their responses to the quiz**. It’s growing your email list on steroids. Apart from their contact details you’ll gather important actionable data about your customers’ preferences which you can use for higher ROI retargeting campaigns further down the funnel.

A product recommendation quiz is a fun way to engage your customers by offering them the chance to learn something about themselves. For example, if you’re selling coffee, a quiz can help your customers discover their “coffee personality” while they learn new facts about different types of coffee and **recommending products that are tailored to their preferences**.

Just **make sure you get their email**! You can do this by offering them an ethical bribe at the end of the quiz like “get your results directly in your inbox and receive a 10% discount coupon for your next purchase”.

With Product Recommendation Quiz, you can use one of the pre-defined quiz templates and modify it (highly recommended) or create a new quiz from scratch.

## Step 2: Draw Subscribers Back to Your Funnel

Ideally, after taking the conversion quiz, your visitors will **proceed to your first Free+Shipping & Upsell funnel (Step 3)**. But this won’t always be the case.

You’ll have to **draw visitors that dropped out back to your sales funnel**.

Remember that in the previous step we used a quiz to segment your customers? In this step you’ll use that data to **send targeted drip email campaigns to segmented lists** that lead subscribers into sales funnels of free+shipping offers and higher-priced product upsells.

You’ll use 2 tools for this: [Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/) and [Meta Pixel](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/).

### Klaviyo

First, [connect your quiz to Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/) to send captured leads to your email marketing list.

!!! info "Connect your quiz to Klaviyo"

    Check this article to learn how to connect your quiz to Klaviyo: [How to Send Quiz Leads to Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/)

The typical **Klaviyo retargeting campaign** consists of a drip flow of 4 emails. The first email is sent immediately and includes the products that have been recommended during the quiz along with a discount code. It also includes a link to a particular Free+Shipping & Upsells funnel. The rest of the emails deliver content which is targeted to that particular client and also link to the same funnel.

**The first email usually brings in 45% of the sales**, the second accounts for 30%, the third accounts for 15% and the fourth usually leads to the final 10% of revenue. These stats show that the first email in any drip campaign is always the most important in terms of engagement. It also highlights the importance of having a drip sequence which follows up.

It is of great importance to create dynamic segments based on your customers’ responses and send each segment different, hyper-targeted campaigns (which return more than [3X the revenue per recipient](https://www.klaviyo.com/marketing-resources/segmentation-benchmark-report) as unsegmented campaigns – more on this later).

With Klaviyo you can [create segments](/how-to-guides/create-segments-in-klaviyo/) to filter your leads and assign email flows to each segment.

### Meta Pixel

A complementary tool we’ll use is the [Meta Pixel](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/). It’s an analytics tool that allows you to measure the effectiveness of your advertising by understanding the actions people take on your quiz.

It collects data that helps you track conversions from Facebook ads, optimize ads, build targeted audiences for future ads (lookalike audiences), and remarket to people who have already taken some kind of action on your website (retargeting).

!!! info "Set up a Meta Pixel"

    If you don’t have one already, follow [these instructions](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/#setting-up-your-meta-pixel) to create a new Pixel on Facebook and connect it to your quiz. 


In our case, we’ll **use the Pixel to create 2 audiences**: 

1. People who have visited the website but still haven’t taken the conversion quiz
2. People who have taken the conversion quiz

!!! tip

    Check Meta documentation to learn how to create audiences: [How to Create Audiences with Meta Pixel](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/164749007013531?id=401668390442328)

Now we’ll create 2 ads campaigns (on Facebook, Instagram or both, depending on your sector). We’ll use them to **drive the first audience to the conversion quiz** (to capture their emails) and the **second audience to our Free+Shipping & Upsells funnels**.

We’ll have several Free+Shipping & Upsells funnels in place, one for each customer type in order to maximize our ROI with hyper-segmentation.

!!! example "Hair care business"

    Let’s say you sell hair care products. You could use the conversion quiz to segment your customers into four categories:

    - Customers with straight hair
    - Customers with wavy hair
    - Customers with curly hair
    - Customers with coily hair

    Then you would create **4 different Free+Shipping & Upsells funnels**, one for each category, and different email drip campaigns drawing customers back to each of the funnels.


## Step 3: Create a Free+Shipping & Upsells funnel

The goals of this funnel are two:

- To separate lookie-loos (no intention of buying) from shoppers
- To make shoppers take action and start buying

We do this with a Free+Shipping offer: **people are inherently attracted to getting stuff for free**, even if they have to pay for the shipping to get it. Now once they’ve pulled out their card and are willing to pay for something (even if it’s only the shipping costs) they’ve already taken the first step and it’s much easier to pitch them upsells.

We show customers **one-time offers where they can get higher price items at discounted rates… but only if they act NOW**. If they accept the offer, you don’t stop there. You pitch them another upsell. Why stop at one if they’re on a shopping run? If they don’t accept any of your upsells, you show them a downsell (a lower price product).

After your clients have gone through the upsells and downsells, they’re taken to the checkout page.

!!! example "Sample Funnel"

    Here’s an example of what a sales funnel would look like: [Skincare Quiz](https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/#quiz-wnHLkP)


I’m sure you can **find ideas of stuff you can give away for free**. Example: a cosmetics store can send free samples of creams and only charge for the shipping.

You can use the RevenueHunt app to create this funnel, just use one of our avialble quiz templates and adapt it to your store. This quiz’s logic is already pre-built to guide your customers through the different offers. You’ll have to edit the texts, change the images and adjust the quiz’s design to match your store’s look & feel.


## Step 4: Optimize your Order Confirmation

Check out this sample Amazon thank you page:

!!! example "Amazon's thank you page"

    ![Amazon's thank you page](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/amazon-thank-you-page.png)

These guys know what they’re doing: they’re **cross-selling products even after the customer has completed the purchase**.

Your store’s order confirmation page (or “thank you” page) gives you the perfect cross-sell opportunity. Also, customers visit the order status page more than once – when receiving default notifications from your store (like shipping updates) via email or SMS.

By optimizing your thank you page and adding upsells or cross-sells, you will re-engage customers who just completed a purchase with your store and **catch them when they are most likely to buy**.

## Step 5: Convert Buyers into Repetitive Buyers

Here’s a metric you should be familiar with: `Repeat Customer Rate` (or `Repeat Purchase Rate`).

Repeat customer rate is the backbone of customer retention. It measures the percentage of customers **willing to make a second purchase from you**. Measuring your repeat purchase rate is an excellent way of evaluating how well your retention strategy is actually working. The higher this metric is, the more willing customers are to return to your store.

Fortunately, this is calculated for you in your [Shopify Analytics](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/reports-and-analytics/shopify-reports). If you want to do this manually, all you need to do is divide the number of customers with more than one purchase by the number of unique customers.

![repeat rate calculation](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/repeat-rate.png)

A repeat purchase is an indicator of a degree of customer loyalty to a brand. It is also an opportunity to establish long-term customer relationships. A high number of repeat purchases indicates a satisfied and “well-retained” customer. This reduces new-customer acquisition costs and increases overall profitability.

The big question is… how can you increase this number?

The business’ repeat purchase rate may be increased using promotions, loyalty programs and exceptional customer service. In summary: **following up with your customers**.

But with average open rates of email campaigns being at only 21.3%, you’ll have to make sure you don’t end up in your customer’s spam folder. The solution to this is **sending the right message to the right customer at the right time** – also known as hyper-segmentation.

[Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/) is an excellent tool for following up both via email and SMS. Combined with Product Recommendation Quiz it will take your follow-up campaigns to the next level. With Product Recommendation Quiz you’ll be able to tag your customers based on their responses and you can create segments in Klaviyo based on these tags.

Unlike traditional subscriber lists, **segments are groupings of contacts defined by a set of conditions**. Lists are static, meaning they grow as people subscribe or are manually added. Segments, on the other hand, are dynamic. They grow as people meet the segments’ conditions and shrink as people no longer meet them.

!!! example "How you can use segments to identify different audiences:"

    - Using a Product Recommendation Quiz to categorize customers based on their product preferences
    - Customers who purchase a new product, so you can watch the segment grow after launch
    - Inactive subscribers who have been on your list for at least 6 months but have never opened or clicked an email
    - Repeat customers, which includes everyone who has purchased at least X number of times before or have spent over Y amount of money


The bottom line here is that highly segmented campaigns return more than 3X the revenue per recipient as unsegmented campaigns thanks to higher open rates and click-through rates.


## Step 6: Turn Happy Customers into Brand Ambassadors

In today’s eCommerce industry, it’s not enough to offer the best products or the cheapest deals. Driving traffic to your Shopify store is only half the battle. If you don’t get your customers to buy, it’s wasted money in ads. So how do we persuade your visitors into buying?

There are multiple elements that are factored into a visitor’s motivation to take action and buy. We’re going to focus on one of the most important: **social proof**. 

Social proof is a **powerful psychological bias that causes us to copy others**. For example, when we are unsure what to do, we often imitate the people around us. People are persuaded more by the actions of others than by any argument we can give them.

Two ways to create social proof in your Shopify store are **customer reviews and user generated content**. Happy customers leave positive reviews, but here’s the catch: you’ll have to ask them to leave one!

When asking for reviews, there are two factors you have to take into account:

- WHEN you ask
- HOW you ask


### WHEN to ask for reviews

In many cases, asking for a review request immediately after the purchase just doesn’t make sense. Normally, we say the ideal time to ask for a review is when you can be sure the buyer journey is over. The product will not only have arrived, but the customer will also have had a decent chance to use it.

This way, they can leave a review that’s really insightful and of high quality, covering everything from the on-site experience to delivery speed and quality of the item received.

We recommend sending a review request when the entire buyer journey has been completed – this could be anywhere from 7 to 30 days depending on the product type and the delivery time.


### HOW to ask for reviews

Our experience is that the best way to do this is to first ask for feedback and later ask for a review. This way, you make sure that if there were any issues during the buyer journey you can address them before they leave a negative review.

Consider using a review app to automate the process of sending review requests. This takes away the stress of sending review requests, which would otherwise be a process you have to do manually. 

## Step 7: Measure, Analyze, Improve and Repeat

An important mistake many store owners make is to consider that the sales cycle ends when a purchase is completed. Nothing could be further from the truth. After a customer has bought a product there are still many cross-sell and upsell opportunities.

Getting existing customers to buy other products from you is much easier (and cheaper) than acquiring new customers. It’s much **more ROI efficient to maintain and grow an existing relationship** with a validated customer than starting from square one with a new visitor.

Additionally, we always recommend merchants to consider **collecting reviews and user-generated content from their customers as part of their sales cycle**. These reviews or “customer success stories” can be used as social proof in other steps of the funnel and in your store.

It’s inevitable to experience some drop-off as customers move down the sales funnel. That’s why it’s important to **measure conversion rates at each step**, so you can monitor and analyze these metrics and run A/B tests. You can use Google Analytics to monitor your funnel’s performance.

Every step of the funnel can be A/B tested and improved. 

!!! example "A few A/B tests that you can run are:"

    - Step 1: different CTAs to draw site traffic to your quiz
    - Step 2: different quiz lengths (benchmark: dropdown increases significantly past the 6th question)
    - Step 3: different ad copy
    - Step 4: different offers, upsells & downsells
    - Step 5: different confirmation page setups
    - Step 6: different email drips (email subject, content, frequency…)

Since you’ll be measuring rates (percentage of customers that go from one step to the next) you can **run more than one A/B test at a time**.

---

eCommerce sales funnels are an easy and profitable upgrade for established stores with existing traffic. They can return the initial investment within just a few weeks.

Ecommerce stores should be using the power of sales funnels to turn cold traffic into subscribers and then into customers.

Sales funnels increase the average order value per visitor. This allows store owners to invest more on ads for their profitable funnels.

This article explains how to build a sales funnel for your eCommerce store.

# How to Convert Leads to Customers

A product recommendation quiz is more than just an engagement tool. Done right, it becomes the foundation of your **customer acquisition and retention strategy**. By capturing contact details and delivering personalized results, you can build trust, drive conversions, and turn first-time quiz takers into long-term buyers.

---

## Why Lead Conversion Matters

Every completed quiz gives you two things:

* **Zero-party data** — insights customers willingly share (skin type, age, goals, preferences).
* **Buying intent** — customers are already engaged and closer to purchase than cold leads.

Instead of letting this data sit idle, you should use it to **personalize follow-ups**. Sending the right product recommendations to the right person at the right time can dramatically increase sales.

---

## Send Result Emails Directly from the App

The simplest way to convert quiz takers is to **send results instantly**. With the 💎Built for Shopify RevenueHunt app, you can email quiz results without needing a third-party tool.

Why this works:

* Customers expect instant results after investing time in a quiz.
* Seeing personalized recommendations in their inbox builds credibility and encourages immediate action.
* You don’t need to set up external tools if you want a quick, lightweight funnel.

How to do it:

1. Add an **Email Address question block** to your quiz.
2. Go to **Quiz Settings → Emails → Respondents**.
3. Enable **Send Results Email** and customize the email template.
4. Personalize it with dynamic content such as product images, titles, and prices.

👉 [Learn how to send result emails](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/)

---

## Connect Your Quiz to a CRM or Marketing Platform

For advanced flows, connect your quiz to your CRM or ESP (Email Service Provider). The app integrates with tools like **Klaviyo, Omnisend, Mailchimp, HubSpot, and Zapier**.

Why this matters:

* You can build **multi-step post-quiz email flows**.
* Quiz answers and recommended products are synced as custom properties in your CRM.
* You can segment your audience (e.g., “dry skin + prefers vegan products”) and target them with tailored campaigns.

Best Practices for Follow-Up Email Flows

Sending results is just the first step. To maximize conversions, follow up with a structured email flow that builds trust and encourages repeat purchases.

Recommended flow for quiz-takers:

- **Results Email** (Immediately): Send the quiz results with recommended products and a clear “Shop Now” CTA.

- **Education Email** (1–2 days later): Provide usage tips, routines, or benefits of the recommended products.

- **Social Proof Email** (3–5 days later): Share testimonials, before/after photos, or customer stories.

- **Incentive Email** (5–7 days later): Offer a discount, free gift, or bundle deal to drive the purchase.

- **Retention Email** (2–3 weeks later): Recommend refills, complementary products, or subscription options.

This sequence works especially well in the beauty and supplements industries, where customer trust and education play a big role in buying decisions.

Example flow in Klaviyo:

1. **Immediately** – Send results with product images and “Shop Now” CTA.
2. **1–2 days later** – Send an educational email with tips for their skin/hair type.
3. **3–5 days later** – Share testimonials or success stories.
4. **5–7 days later** – Offer a discount code or bundle deal.
5. **2–3 weeks later** – Retarget with refills or complementary products.

👉 [Send leads to Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/)
👉 [See all integrations](/how-to-guides/integrations/)

---

## Other Tips for Converting Leads

* **Make the email optional**: Some customers prefer immediate results without sharing details. This keeps the experience frictionless while still capturing quality leads from engaged users.
* **Offer incentives**: Reward customers for completing the quiz with a discount or free gift. This boosts both lead capture and conversions.
* **Use personalization**: Address the customer by name and recall their quiz answers in follow-ups. This makes your messages feel like expert advice, not generic marketing.
* **Track performance**: Monitor open rates, click-through rates, and conversions in your ESP to refine your post-quiz funnel.

---

✅ By combining instant result emails with a CRM-powered follow-up flow, you’ll transform your quiz into a **conversion engine** that nurtures leads into loyal customers.

# How to Build a Successful Product Recommendation Quiz

Building a product selector for your eCommerce store has never been easier with our completely new `💎Built for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app. 

!!! info "💎Built for Shopify RevenueHunt app"

    The `💎Built for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app is a new version of the app that went through a complete re-design.

    With our modern drag-and-drop builder, extensive design options, and powerful recommendation engine, you can create stunning quizzes that perfectly match your brand. We offer a variety of design and content [templates](https://revenuehunt.com/templates/) tailored specially for the beauty industry (skin care quiz, hair care quiz, lipstick match finder) and other verticals.

While creating a quiz is straightforward, ensuring it serves both your audience and your business requires some strategic thinking. At RevenueHunt, **we've analyzed countless successful product recommendation quizzes** and built our new Shopify app based on what works best. We've identified elements that make quizzes popular with online shoppers and drive results for brands.

In this article, we've gathered all this knowledge to help you build a high-converting product selector that uses the latest features of our platform.

<div class="videoWrapper">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJaiwjhyNgI?si=3XG85TzxvvXtsTw0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Here’s a list of things every Product Recommendation Quiz should have (and how to add them):

## 1. Make the quiz visible

*(publish on the header, publish in multiple locations)*

You can have the most beautiful and thought-through quiz in the world but it won't be useful if your customers cannot find it. Just like a real-life shop attendant, the quiz should reach out to the customers to ask *"Is there anything I can help you with?"*. 

Our new  `💎Built for Shopify` RevenueHunt app offers native integration with your store, making it easier than ever to [publish your quiz](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz/). Unlike the legacy version that used iframes, the new version embeds directly into your store's theme for better performance and seamless integration. 

!!! info "You can:"

    - Add the quiz as a native Shopify block anywhere on your pages
    - Create a floating chat-like button that follows customers as they browse
    - Set up automatic popups for new visitors
    - Embed the quiz inline with your content
    - Add quiz links to your navigation menu

Most successful quizzes are **published in multiple locations** to help customers at different stages of their shopping journey. 

!!! example "You can publish your quiz in multiple locations:"

    - A native quiz block in your homepage header showcases the quiz as a key feature
    - A floating button provides easy access as customers browse your collections
    - An automatic popup engages first-time visitors
    - Inline quizzes within relevant collection pages help customers make informed choices (e.g., a shade finder quiz in your lipstick collection)

![how to build a succesful quiz image1](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image1.png)

Ensuring that the quiz is easy to find can make a big difference in your sales conversions. Most quiz takers try the quiz a few times before completing the purchase. Make the quiz visible and you’ll see the sales go up!

## 2. Match the store’s design

*(Design: match stores font and color scheme, use a background image, CSS)*

You know this already. A beautifully designed website sells better than a generic one and so does the quiz! Our new  `💎Built for Shopify` app takes quiz design to the next level with a powerful visual design system.

!!! info "Quiz Design Options"

    The new [Quiz Design](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/) interface features a Shopify-like Block Editor that makes customization intuitive and powerful:

    - **Visual Block Editor**: Add, reorder, and customize blocks for questions, results, product slots, and HTML content with simple drag-and-drop
    - **Typography & Colors**: Fine-tune your fonts, colors, and button styles to match your brand perfectly
    - **Modern Templates**: Choose from our collection of professionally designed templates built specifically for Shopify
    - **Layout Control**: Adjust spacing, alignment, and layout without touching code
    - **Custom CSS/JS**: For advanced users, you still have full control through custom code

The native integration with Shopify means your quiz will inherit some of your theme's styles automatically (like your website's font), creating a matching experience. You can then customize further to make it uniquely yours. Check out these beautiful [customization examples](https://revenuehunt.com/templates/#customization) to gather inspiration for your next quiz project!

![how to build a succesful quiz image2](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image2.png)

## 3. Come up with a professional name for the quiz

*(Eg. “Shade Finder”, “Personalized Skin Prescription”, “Routine Builder”, “Skin Test”)*

Let’s talk names now. When you hear the word ‘quiz’, what is the first thing that comes to mind? To most people a quiz is either a dreadful school memory or a lighthearted ‘Which animal are you?’ entertainment. The truth is, the word quiz doesn’t have the best reputation, but fortunately you don’t have to stick with it. 

Finding the right name for your quiz can sometimes be key to getting more conversions. A **‘Shade finder’**, a **‘Skincare Routine builder’**, **‘Skin Diagnostic’**, **‘Hair Analysis’** sound more like a professional questionnaire than entertainment, don’t they? The secret is in the name, so try to find something that fits your brand well and provides value for the customer. If you’re not sure what to choose, think about your customer’s most asked questions and start there.

![how to build a succesful quiz image3](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image3.jpg)

## 4. Add personalized advice

*(Jump logic, Skip logic, Display logic)*

One way to make the quiz more than just a product selector is to add personalized advice based on customer answers. Our new `💎Built for Shopify` app makes this easier than ever with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for conditional logic.

!!! info "Conditional Logic"

    The new visual [Conditional Logic](/how-to-guides/hide-content-with-logic/) builder lets you create complex personalization flows without any coding:

    - Design complex branching paths with an intuitive interface similar to Shopify's theme editor with our visual logic builder
    - Chose from multiple logic types:

        - **Jump Logic**: Send customers to different questions based on their answers
        - **Skip Logic**: Hide irrelevant questions automatically
        - **Display Logic**: Show/hide content blocks based on previous answers
        - **Score Logic**: Track points and create personality-based recommendations


!!! example "When can I use logic?"

    - Does your customer have dry skin? Use Jump Logic to direct them to specific questions about dry skin concerns, completely skipping the oily skin path

    - Your customer suffers from hair loss? Create a branching path with Jump Logic that explores different causes (medication, genetic conditions, lifestyle) and provides tailored product recommendations and advice

    - Want to show special content to premium customers? Use Display Logic to reveal exclusive offers based on their responses

The visual logic builder makes it easy to create an experience that feels like talking to a real expert, guiding customers to the perfect products for their needs.

![how to build a succesful quiz image4](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic.png)

The same logic can also be applied to the contents of the Results Page. A different content block can be shown to customers with dry skin and oily skin. A different advice can be given to customers with colored or natural hair. 

![how to build a succesful quiz image4](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_answers_example1.png)

The Results Page is also a great place to give additional “how to use” advice or even add a prediction on how their skin will improve in the months/weeks of using the product (all depending on the customer's skin type).

## 5. Use descriptive pictures to help customers decide

*(Design your own icons & add picture questions)*

It is not always easy to know whether you have dry or oily skin, whether your complexion is light or dark, what exactly your hair-color is called… There’s no better way to help the customer choose than by showing them an example. 

Adding a **[Picture question](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-types)** to your Product Recommendation Quiz can be a great way to help the customer pick the right answer and help them make an educated purchasing decision. You can add real-life examples for your customers to relate to or design your own beautiful icons that will match your store’s style. A visual quiz gets more completions than a fully-text-based one, so make sure to include some images!

![how to build a succesful quiz image5](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image5.jpg)

![how to build a succesful quiz image6](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image6.jpg)

## 6. Keep it short

*(Max. 5-6 questions)*

This is probably the most important piece of advice on this list. No matter what you do, if your Product Recommendation Quiz is too long, you’ll not see the desired effects. 

Our research shows that most successful quizzes have **max. 5-6 questions**. In other cases, customers typically drop out after question 8 and almost nobody gets to question 12. There’s power in simplicity! Even if your quiz has some branching, make sure that the total time they spent on the quiz is less than 1-2 minutes.

## 7. Limit the recommended products

*(1-2, or 1 for each type)*

The less choice we have, the less time we spend deciding and the higher the chance we'll buy. Our new `💎Built for Shopify` app gives you powerful tools to create focused, personalized recommendations.

!!! info "Flexible Recommendation System"

    - **Dynamic Recommendations**: Products are recommended based on customer responses, using our intelligent voting system
    - **Fixed Recommendations**: Manually choose specific products for certain answer combinations
    - **Collection Recommendations**: Recommend entire collections instead of individual products - perfect for bundles, seasonal lines, or product types
    - **Recommendation Slots**: Create structured routines by assigning products to specific slots (e.g., cleanser, toner, moisturizer)

Best Practices:

- For simple products: Recommend 1-2 best-matching items
- For routines: Use slots to recommend one product per category
- For collections: Show a curated collection that matches their needs
- Use fixed recommendations for your best-sellers or when you want complete control

The key is to make the choice clear and focused. What's the point of a quiz if you end up with 10 results from which you still need to choose? Keep it simple and watch your conversion rates grow.

![how to build a succesful quiz image7](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image7.png)

## 8. Make it Personalized

*(Recall names & answers)*

Want to make the shopping experience ultra personal? RevenueHunt app lets you use the information provided by the customer and add it to various parts of the quiz. You can, for example, ask for a person’s name and recall the answer in the next question, on the Results Page or even in the follow-up email. [Information Recalls or Content Dynamic Source](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) are a powerful tool which makes your quiz look professional, while actually being very simple to implement. 

Take a look at this example of a haircare quiz:

![how to build a succesful quiz image8](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image8.gif)

## 9. Send results to the customer if they want

*(Email, Klaviyo, Omnisend, Mailchimp...)*

A well-structured sales funnel, with a Product Recommendation Quiz and a targeted email campaign, can lead to 50% higher conversions. A quiz can serve as an excellent lead collector. Not only are you able to get email addresses or phone numbers via the quiz, but you can also segment your audience based on their quiz answers and follow up with an email tailored to their needs. 

Think about a marketing campaign focused on people living in large urban areas, where a proper morning or evening skin routine is especially important for a clear complexion. Big brands know that a swift follow-up is crucial to maintaining the customer’s attention. 

With RevenueHunt app, you’re able to [send quiz results](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/) directly to the customer seconds after completing the quiz. You can even connect your quiz to [Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/) and send the customer a full list of results including product pictures, descriptions, discount codes or instructions for use.

While collecting emails is a very important part of a sales, some customers prefer to take time before trusting your brand with this information. Some customers will leave immediately and some just want to see the results. To ensure the quality of the leads generated by the quiz the RevenueHunt app allows you to **make the email question optional** or even give a customer a choice if they want to see it or not.

## 10. Offer a discount after completing

*(Automatic discounts)*

This one is simple but effective! You want to reward your customers for taking a minute of their time to fill in all this valuable information (for your business). Adding a [discount code](/how-to-guides/add-discount/) at the end of the quiz can be a great way to encourage shoppers to finish the purchase. RevenueHunt app syncs the discount codes you’ve set up in your store and can apply them automatically to every shopping cart.

You can even add a special code to be used at checkout for the people who answer a specific question. For example, a special discount for customers who want both,a day and night routine, to be recommended.

![how to build a succesful quiz image9](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image9.gif)

## 11. Go Global with Shopify Markets

*(Multi-language and multi-currency support)*

Our `💎Built for Shopify` app now fully integrates with Shopify Markets, making it easy to serve customers worldwide with localized experiences:

- **Multiple Languages**: Create separate quiz versions for different languages
- **Automatic Market Detection**: Show the right quiz version based on visitor location
- **Currency Adaptation**: Display prices in local currencies automatically
- **Market-Specific Content**: Customize product recommendations and advice for different regions
- **Seamless Integration**: Works naturally with your Shopify Markets configuration

!!! tip "Best Practices"

    - Create separate quizzes for your main market languages
    - Use market-specific product recommendations when needed
    - Keep quiz logic consistent across versions
    - Test your quiz in different markets to ensure a smooth experience

This powerful integration helps you create a truly global shopping experience while maintaining the personal touch that makes quizzes so effective.

## Plans & pricing details

### Feature availability for paid-only options

We encourage you to try and test all features you might need before committing to a paid plan. That's why we offer a free trial period, so you can explore our advanced features and see how they work for your business.

- Add custom HTML, custom CSS, and custom JavaScript to quizzes
- Add custom Chart.js charts

During your trial period, you can test them while on the Free plan. After the trial ends, you can still test them in the quiz preview and inside the quiz builder, but they won’t work on live quizzes until you upgrade to a paid plan.

## Upgrading and downgrading plans
    If you need to upgrade temporarily for a marketing campaign, you can downgrade later on to a smaller plan if your usage is lower. You can easily do it yourself from the [Plans & Pricing](/reference/plans-pricing/) page in the app.
    Bear in mind that if you need to upgrade/downgrade we’re very flexible. When changing plans Stripe will automatically discount the proportional part of the monthly plan that hasn’t been used.

## What counts as a paid response?
Quiz Responses are counted as the number of people who have completed the quiz (reached the Results Page). If someone starts the quiz and abandons it partway through, this does not count as a response.
You can check your responses in the [Metrics > Analytics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#analytics) tab inside the Quiz Builder.
## When do my plan responses reset?
The way our billing system works is that every day it’s calculating the responses captured during the past 30 days (rolling), so the corresponding plan and the charges are made based on usage in retrospect.
You can check the Metrics -> Analytics panel to check how many responses your quiz received in the past 30 days.
—
It’s best to explain it based on an example. Let’s say that you are on a Basic plan which allows up to 500 responses per month. These are the number of responses you’ve gotten in the last 30 days:
![plans pricing faq explanation1](/images/plans_pricing_faq_explanation1.png)
So:
- On day 1, you got 32 answers
- On day 2 you got 16 answers
- On day 3 you got 0 answers, (so none at all) and so on.
If you check the “Total last 30 days” cell, that’s where we add the number of responses of the last 30 days. We get a total of 500 responses. This means your plan’s usage has reached its limit. Thus, the “Available Responses” is 0.
Now, when does this reset?
Let’s say, that the following day – you get 0 responses. The 30 days would “Roll”, and your table would look like this:
![plans pricing faq explanation2](/images/plans_pricing_faq_explanation2.png)
You’ll notice that ALL of the days were “bumped” 1 day back. For example, “Day 3” on the first table, is now on “Day 2”, “Day 4” is now “Day 3” and so on. Meaning, the usage of day 1 has rolled out, and as you haven’t got any new answers, now you have the 32 responses that you had previously on day #1 available – because the sum of your “new” table is only 468 (As the previous day 1 with 32 responses “rolled out”).
## Changing plans example
For further clarification: billing cycle =/= our measuring period. We don’t set a date on which we begin or end measuring, rather, we always measure the last 30 days, rolling.
If you pay on the 15th for a Basic plan, you have the ability to get 500 responses within the past 30 days. For example, on the 15th we will look back 30 days and we will count the number of responses you’ve received those days. On the 22nd, we will look back 30 days, and so on…  Take a look at the spreadsheet [explanation above](#when-do-my-plan-responses-reset).
In this example, if you pay on May 15th the Basic plan, and you have a surge of responses let’s say on the 10th – 28th of a month, the following will happen:
1. As soon as you’re near 90% of your plan’s usage (in the Basic plan, this means when you’ve accumulated 450 responses in the last 30 days) we will warn you and let you know you might reach 100% which will require upgrading your plan.
2. If the usage keeps being high and you cross your plan’s limit, we will also let you know. As mentioned before, we will never block your quiz immediately, you’ll have plenty of time to do so.
3. Let’s say you’re now over your Basic plan, as you have been receiving a lot of responses that make you stay over 500 responses (to learn how the responses accumulate, please check the article thread above). But you already got charged again for the Basic plan, as the 15th of the month has passed. Let’s say that we’re on the 20th of a month here.
This means that, if you upgrade immediately to a Pro plan (allows 1000 responses/30 days), Shopify will only charge for 6 days of your plan (as that’s how many days you’ve used your Basic plan since the 15th). Your new billing cycle will be on the 20th of each month. Now, you’re able to receive 1000 responses “within the last 30 days” on a Pro plan. If you upgraded on the 20th, we will look back 30 days, and we will count your responses. If you’re under 1000, you’re good to go.
In other words: if the Basic plan accepts around ~16 responses each day, the Pro plan will accept ~33 responses every day, without ever crossing the 1000 responses limit / rolling 30 days (16 * 30 = 500, 33 * 30 = 1000)
## Monthy vs yearly plan
    If you’ve just installed the RevenueHunt app, it is advised to stay on a monthly plan for some time to check your quiz usage. 
    Once you’re sure of what your stable usage is in a month, you can choose to pay for a yearly plan upfront with a reduced monthly rate. To buy a yearly plan, navigate to the [Plans & Pricing tab](/reference/plans-pricing/) in the app and select “show yearly”.

## Discounts
We offer a 50% discount on all plans if you subscribe for 2 years and you pay upfront. However, we do recommend starting with the monthly plan, for 2-3 months until you start getting results & sales, before committing to a 2-year plan.

## What’s the difference between the WooCommerce extension and a WordPress plugin?
The [WordPress Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/product-recommendation-quiz-for-ecommerce/) is free to install and puts you directly on our **Free plan**. The Free plan allows up to 100 quiz responses per month without any charges but has a “Powered by RevenueHunt” branding. If your usage exceeds the Free plan, you’ll be asked to upgrade to a Basic plan which is billed monthly.
The [WooCommerce extension](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-recommendation-quiz-for-woocommerce/) requires a yearly subscription (29$/year) to install the app and puts you on a **Starter Plan**. The Starter Plan allows up to 250 quiz responses per month and has the “Powered by RevenueHunt” branding removed. If your usage exceeds the Starter plan, you’ll be asked to upgrade to a Basic plan which is billed monthly.

# Why Your Product Quiz is NOT Converting Well

Product quizzes are a great way to personalize shopping experiences and boost sales, but sometimes they just don’t hit the mark. If your quiz isn’t converting as well as you’d like, you’re not alone.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jmjHlwEErI?si=a5bEg-I7CrPHPj7T" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

Here are some common reasons why your quiz is not working well and how you can fix it.

## 🎯  You Don’t Have Clear Goals

If you don’t know what you want your quiz to achieve, it’s hard to make it effective. Are you trying to *increase sales*, *gather customer data*, or just *engage your audience*?

Without a clear purpose, your quiz might miss the mark.

**Solution**

Decide what you want your quiz to do. For instance, if you want to boost sales, make sure your questions help guide users to only the products you know they’ll love. Keep track of metrics that show you’re reaching your goals, like conversion rates and average order value.


| Goal | Solution |
|------|-----------|
| **Increasing Sales** | • `Define Sales Objectives`: Set specific targets, like increasing average order value or boosting conversion rates by X%.<br><br>• `Tailored Product Recommendations`: Ensure your quiz directs users to products they are more likely to buy based on their answers and that you don't show too many products on your results page (recommending 1 product that matches all customer criteria is best). |
| **Gathering Customer Data** | • `Focus on Insights`: Design questions that help you understand your customers' preferences and behaviors.<br><br>• `Data Collection`: Use the quiz to gather valuable information like email addresses, preferences, and pain points. You can easily [download all the quiz responses](/how-to-guides/download-quiz-responses/) or [connect your quiz to GA4](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) for advanced behavioral analytics. |
| **Engaging Your Audience** | • `Interactive Elements`: Include engaging and fun elements like images, videos, and gamified components. Visual quizzes maintain the customer's attention.<br><br>• `Entertainment and Informative Value`: Make sure the quiz is enjoyable and informative, keeping the audience interested but also feeling like they are learning something. |

!!! tip "Tip: Check Metrics"

    Check the [Quiz Metrics & Analytics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/) section for insights on your quiz engagement and sales.

    Our latest article explains which quiz metrics are important and how to improve them: [Product Quiz Metrics: What to Track to Convert Better](/customer-success/track-quiz-metrics-for-better-conversions/)


## 🥱 Your Questions Are Boring

If your quiz is boring, users won’t stick around to finish it. A dull design, lack of interactivity, and uninspiring content can all lead to low engagement.

Long, complex, or irrelevant questions can also drive users away. If your questions are too generic, they won’t provide a personalized experience.

**Solution**

Make your quiz visually appealing and interactive. Use images, videos, and animations to keep it interesting. Add elements like progress bars and instant feedback to make the experience more fun.

![visually appealing and interactive quiz](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-10-090342-e1720595102774.png)

Keep your questions short, sweet, and to the point. Make sure they’re relevant to what your customers care about. Use simple language and avoid jargon. Every question should help you understand your customers better or steer them toward the right product.

| Goal | Solution |
|------|-----------|
| **Increasing Sales** | • `Interactive Elements`: Use interactive questions and features to keep users interested.<br><br>• `Relevant Questions, Direct Path to Purchase`: Ask only questions that help narrow down the best products for the user. Ensure questions are geared towards identifying products that fit the user's needs.<br><br>• `Product Highlights`: Showcase product benefits and unique selling points throughout the product description in the quiz. |
| **Gathering Customer Data** | • `Fun Questions`: Make data-gathering questions fun and engaging.<br><br>• `Rewards for Participation`: Offer incentives for completing the quiz, like [discounts](/how-to-guides/add-discount/) or entries into a giveaway.<br><br>• `Insightful Queries`: Include questions that provide deeper insights into customer preferences and demographics.<br><br>• `Progressive Profiling`: Gradually gather more detailed information with each quiz interaction. |
| **Engaging Your Audience** | • `Entertaining Questions`: Use questions that are fun and engaging, such as personality-based or lifestyle questions.<br><br>• `Gamification`: Incorporate elements of gamification, such as progress bars and badges.<br><br>• `Visual Appeal`: Incorporate images and videos to make questions more interesting.<br><br>• `Storytelling`: Use a narrative approach to make the quiz more engaging. |

!!! tip "Tip: Use Picture Questions"

    Use [Picture Questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) to add images or animated gifs to your quiz choices in the RevenueHunt quiz app.

!!! tip "Tip: Upload Images and Videos"

    You can upload [images and videos](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/#adding-images-and-videos) to any quiz question in the RevenueHunt quiz app.


## 🤔 Your Results Are Too Generic

If you recommend too many products to the customer, they still will not know what to put in their cart. Recommending too many products ads an extra decision step in the customer’s shopping journey.

If your quiz results aren’t personalized, users will feel like they wasted their time. Generic results won’t make users excited about your products.

**Solution**

Recommend a single product that matches all the customer criteria or a full routine with one product per step. This way the customer will know what to add to cart right away and it will significantly increase your conversion rate.

![single product recommendation](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-10-090001.png)

Use the data from the quiz to give personalized recommendations. Make sure the results are specific to each user’s answers. Highlight why these products are perfect for them.

| Goal | Solution |
|------|-----------|
| **Increasing Sales** | • `Personalized Recommendations`: Provide highly tailored product suggestions based on quiz answers.<br><br>• `Highlight Benefits`: Clearly explain why each recommended product is a great fit for the user. |
| **Gathering Customer Data** | • `Detailed Insights`: Offer results that give users a deep understanding of their preferences and needs.<br><br>• `Encourage Profile Completion`: Use results to prompt users to complete their profiles for even more personalized recommendations. |
| **Engaging Your Audience** | • `Interactive Results`: Make the results page interactive, with clickable elements that lead to more content or products.<br><br>• `Shareable Outcomes`: Create results that are fun to share on social media, increasing engagement. |


!!! tip

## 📢 Weak Calls to Action (CTAs)

If your CTAs aren’t clear or strong, users might not know what to do next. This can lead to missed conversions.

**Solution**

Make your CTAs clear and direct. Whether it’s “Shop Now,” “Learn More,” or “Get Your Results,” make sure users know what to do next. Experiment with different texts and placements to see what works best.



| Goal | Solution |
|------|-----------|
| **Increasing Sales** | • `Strong CTAs`: Use clear and compelling CTAs like "Shop Now" or "Buy Now."<br><br>• `Prominent Placement`: Ensure CTAs are prominently placed and easy to find. |
| **Gathering Customer Data** | • `Data-Driven CTAs`: Encourage users to provide more information with CTAs like "Tell Us More" or "Complete Your Profile."<br><br>• `Lead Magnets`: Offer incentives for sharing data, such as [discounts](/how-to-guides/add-discount/) or free samples. |
| **Engaging Your Audience** | • `Engagement CTAs`: Use CTAs that encourage further interaction, like "Take Another Quiz" or "Read More Tips."<br><br>• `Social Sharing`: Include CTAs that prompt users to share their results on social media. |


!!! tip "Tip: Change CTAs"

    You can change the text of any button or CTA in your quiz in the [Quiz Settings > Messages](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#messages) section or directly in each question settings.


## 💌 No Follow-Up

The interaction shouldn’t end with the quiz results. If you don’t follow up, you miss out on potential sales and customer relationships.

**Solution**

Have a follow-up plan. Send personalized emails with the quiz results, product recommendations, and special offers.

Use retargeting ads to remind users about their quiz results and encourage them to come back.


| Goal | Solution |
|------|-----------|
| **Increasing Sales** | • `Email Follow-Ups`: [Send personalized emails](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/) with product recommendations based on quiz results.<br><br>• `Special Offers`: Include exclusive [discounts](/how-to-guides/add-discount/) or offers in the follow-up to encourage purchases. |
| **Gathering Customer Data** | • `Survey Follow-Ups`: Send follow-up surveys to gather more detailed customer insights.<br><br>• `Profile Completion`: Encourage users to complete their profiles with follow-up emails. |
| **Engaging Your Audience** | • `Content Follow-Ups`: Provide additional content related to the quiz results, like blog posts or videos.<br><br>• `Engagement Reminders`: Use follow-up emails to remind users of their quiz results and encourage further interaction. |

!!! tip "Tip: Send Follow-Up Emails"

    With RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz you can [send follow-up emails](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/) to quiz takers directly from the app or [connect the quiz to your CRM](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-crm/) and set up a post-quiz email flow there.

### **Step 1 – Plan & Name Your Quiz**

Your quiz name sets the tone and expectation. A professional, problem-solving title makes customers take it seriously and increases engagement.


☐ Define the customer problem your quiz should solve (e.g., find the right moisturizer, build a full routine) and make a quiz map with questions and outcomes.

☐ Choose a professional name that matches your brand (*Shade Finder*, *Routine Builder*, *Skin Diagnostic*)

??? example "Example: Professional Quiz Name"

    ![quiz name example](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC3-ALPHAH-768x340.jpg)

---


### **Step 2 – Build Questions**

Your [questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-types) should be **short, clear, and visual** when possible. Customers drop off if the quiz feels too long or confusing.

☐ Add a **Welcome** slide that clearly sets expectations — explain what the customer will gain from the quiz and how long it will take. Keep it visually engaging and highlight any reward for completion (e.g., a discount code or free gift).

☐ Keep total length **5–6 questions** (under 2 minutes)

!!! warning
    We've noticed a significant drop-off in quiz completion rates when the quiz is over 6 questions-long and almost nobody makes it to question 12. Keep the quiz short and concise or it won't achieve the desired results.

☐ Add **picture questions** for clarity and engagement (skin tones, hair colors, product types)

??? info "How to Add a Picture Question"

    Add a question by clicking `+ Add question` or `+ Add block`. Choose [Picture Choice](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#picture-choice) if you want to show images/icons instead of text-only answers.

    ![picture choice example1](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC6-LUCE-768x242.jpg)

    ![picture choice example2](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC5-TBJ-768x244.jpg)


---


### **Step 3 – Add Personalization & Logic**

Personalization makes your quiz feel like a real consultation. [Smart logic](/how-to-guides/use-conditional-logic/) skips irrelevant questions and tailors advice to each customer.

☐ Use [**Jump Logic**](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/) to branch into relevant paths OR [**Skip Logic**](/how-to-guides/use-skip-logic/) to hide irrelevant questions

??? example "Example: Showing different advice based on previous answers"

    ![jump logic example](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic.png)

    Check this article to learn how to branch the quiz based on previous answers: [How to Use Jump Logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/)


☐ Add **personalized advice** on the results page (e.g., dry vs oily skin tips) and use [**Display Logic**](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/) for showing targeted advice (e.g., show different advice based on skin type)

??? example "Example: Advice based on calculated skin type"

    ![display logic example](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_variable_example1.png)

    Check this article to learn how to set up a quiz that determines the user's skin type and shows personalized advice and products: [How to Set Up a Winning Variable Quiz](/how-to-guides/set-up-scoring-quiz/#winning-variable-quiz)

☐ Enable [Information Recalls](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) (e.g., greet by name, reuse answers)

??? example "Example: Recalling information from previous questions"

    ![information recalls example](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC8-Recalls.gif)

    Check this article to learn how to recall information from previous questions: [How to Use Information Recalls](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/)


---

### **Step 4 – Configure Recommendations**

The power of a quiz lies in guiding customers to clear choices. Too many results cause decision fatigue, while focused suggestions drive purchases.

☐ Show only **1 top product**

??? example "Example: Showing one matching product"

    ![recommendations example](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC7-UNDID_Blurred.png){width="500"}

☐ Use **recommendation slots** for routines, 1 product per slot (cleanser, serum, toner, etc.)

??? example "Example: Skincare routine recommendations"

    ![recommendations example](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/images/how_to_recommend_slots_example.png)
    
    Check this article to learn how to set up a quiz that recommends a skincare routine: [How to Set Up a Funnel Quiz with Slots](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/set-up-funnel-quiz/#funnel-quiz-with-slots)

☐ Apply a slot with **fixed recommendations** for best-sellers

??? info "How to Set Up Fixed Recommendations"

    Check this article to learn how to set up a quiz that recommends a best-seller: [How to Set Up a Funnel Quiz with Fixed Recommendations](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/set-up-fixed-recommendations-quiz/#always-the-same-recommendations)

---

### **Step 5 – Design & Branding**

A quiz that visually matches your store feels like part of your brand and builds trust. Good design keeps the quiz engaging and boosts completion rates.

??? info "How to Customize Quiz Design"

    Check this article to learn how to customize the quiz design: [Customize Quiz Design](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/)

    Note that the `💎Built for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app automatically pulls your Shopify theme’s base font.

    ![quiz design example](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC1-OLAPLEX_Blurred-1024x452.png)

☐ Apply your **store fonts and color scheme**

☐ Add a **background image** or icons that fit your style

☐ Use the **visual block editor** to arrange quiz elements

☐ Add **custom CSS/JS** for advanced tweaks


---

### **Step 6 – Capture Leads & Send Results**

Collecting emails turns quiz takers into long-term customers. Sending results builds trust and creates opportunities for follow-up campaigns.

☐ Add an [**email question**](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#email-address) to gather leads from the quiz

??? tip "Make the email question *optional*"

    To don't hurt your quiz conversions, you can make the email question optional in [email question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#email). This way users will be able to opt-out but still can see their results.

    ![email question settings](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_questions_blocksettings_email.png)


☐ Enable [result emails](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/) to send results to the quiz takers who left their email

??? info "Tutorial: Sending Emails"

    Check this video tutorial to learn how to send emails with the RevenueHunt app: [Sending Emails](/tutorials/sending-emails/)

☐ For advanced features, [connect the quiz to your CRM](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-crm/) (eg. Klaviyo, Omnisend, Mailchimp, Webhooks, etc.) and set up a follow-up email campaign

☐ Personalize emails with quiz answers + product recommendations

---

### **Step 7 – Add Incentives**

Rewards encourage customers to act immediately. A discount code is a simple but effective way to boost conversions after the quiz.

☐ If you haven't yet, add a Welcome slide that clearly sets expectations — explain what the customer will gain from the quiz and highlight any **reward for completion**.

☐ If available for your platform, create and add an [automatic discount code](/how-to-guides/add-discount/) for quiz finishers

☐ Create a discount code for quiz takers and **add the dicount code as text** to the quiz last question or results page

??? example "Example: Discount Code"

    ![discount code example](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC9-discount.gif)

---

### **Step 8 – Publish Your Quiz**

Even the best quiz won’t help if no one sees it. Make your quiz highly visible across your store to maximize engagement. Most successful quizzes are **published in multiple locations** on the website to help customers at different stages of their shopping journey.

??? tip "Is there anything I can help you with?"

    Just like a real-life shop attendant, the quiz should reach out to the customers to ask *"Is there anything I can help you with?"*. 

    ![publishing your quiz](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC1-UN_DID_Blurred-768x402.png)

??? info "How to Publish Your Quiz"

    Check this article to learn how to publish your quiz in different ways: [How to Publish Your Quiz](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz/)


☐ Add links to the quiz in the [**navigation menu**](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-link/#link-popup-in-website-menu)

☐ Add a [**banner with a button**](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-link/#link-popup-as-take-the-quiz-button) to open the quiz

☐ Add quiz as a [**inline block**](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-inline/#embedding-an-inline-quiz-on-a-dedicated-landing-page) on dedicated landing page or homepage

☐ Set up an [**automatic popup**](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-automatic-popup/) for first-time visitors

---

### **Step 9 – Optimize for Global Stores**

If you sell internationally, your quiz should adapt just like your store. Localization in language, currency, and products builds trust and increases sales abroad.

??? tip "How to Set Up a Quiz for Multiple Markets"

    In Markets tab of the app, assign a quiz to a specific Shopify Market. You can duplicate a quiz and translate it with Copilot for quick multi-language setup.

    Check this video tutorial to learn how to set up a quiz for multiple markets: [Assign Quizzes to Shopify Markets and Languages](/tutorials/shopify-markets/)

☐ Create separate quizzes for **different languages**

☐ Test **currency display** in Shopify Markets

☐ Adjust recommendations for **region-specific needs**

☐ Test quizzes in multiple markets to confirm smooth experience





---

✅ Done! Your quiz is now ready to guide customers like a real store assistant — driving higher engagement, more conversions, and global reach.

# How to Reduce Drop-off and Maximize Quiz Completion Rate

Quizzes can be a powerful tool to engage users, collect valuable data, and even segment your audience for targeted marketing. However, creating a quiz that maintains the user's interest from start to finish can be challenging. High drop-off rates can significantly affect the effectiveness of your quiz.

This guide offers practical steps and strategies to reduce drop-off rates and maximize quiz completion rates.

## Step 1: Review Drop-Off Metrics 

Start by examining the [drop-off metrics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#drop-off) provided by RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz. These metrics will highlight where participants are leaving the quiz, allowing you to pinpoint problem areas effectively.

![drop-off metrics](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_metrics_analytics_dropoff.png)


**Which data to check?**

First, identify `High Drop-off Questions`.  Focus on questions with the highest drop-off rates, especially those asking for personal details like email addresses. These are typically where you might lose participants' interest or willingness to continue.

!!! info "Drop-off Rate Formulas"

    Overall Drop-off Rate: *Drop-off Rate (%) = [(Quiz Starts – Quiz Completions) ÷ Quiz Starts] × 100* 

    Per-Question Drop-off Rate: *Drop-off Rate at Question i (%) = [(Users who reached Question i – Users who reached Question i+1) ÷ Users who reached Question i] × 100*

    Completion Rate: *Completion Rate (%) = [Quiz Completions ÷ Quiz Starts] × 100*


Then, check the following metrics:

- `Start Rate` - % of page visitors who actually start the quiz. **Why?** Low = landing page headline/CTA issue, slow load, or poor value proposition.

- `Completion Rate` - % of quiz starts that reach the results screen. **Why?** The high-level success metric you’re trying to improve.

- `Per-Question Exit Rate` - Drop-off % at each question. **Why?** Pinpoints the exact step(s) causing abandonment.

- `Average Time Per Question` - Look for spikes: if one question takes 2–3× longer than others, it’s either confusing or too demanding.

- `Total Quiz Duration` - Average time from first to last question. **Why?** Compare against your design goal (≤60–90s). Longer times predict higher abandonment.

- `Lead Capture Metrics` - % of users who provide email when asked. **Why?** Check drop-off before vs. after this step — forcing email can sink completions.

- `Leads per 100 Quiz Starts` - Combines completion + opt-in. Useful for seeing if completion rate tradeoffs are worth it.



## Step 2: Implement Strategies for Reducing Drop-off

Once you know where the problem is try implementing these strategies to reduce drop-off within your Product Recommendation Quiz:


### Value Up Front

- **Expose the value up front.** First screen: what they get + how long it takes. E.g., “Takes 45s. Get your routine + 10% off.”

- **Set a time budget.** Design for ≤60–90 seconds total or **max. 5–8 questions**. Anything longer needs a clear value promise (“3-step routine + 10% off”).


### Quiz Length & Flow

- **Kill irrelevant questions with branching.** Use [jump/skip logic](/how-to-guides/use-conditional-logic/) so each path is ≤6 questions. If a question doesn’t change the recommendation, remove it.

- **Sequence for momentum.** Start with the easiest, most visual questions; place the longest/most personal near the end.

- **Offer “I’m not sure.”** Add a neutral choice that still maps to a safe default. Users shouldn’t feel stuck.

### Question & Answer Design

- **Prefer tap over typing.** Replace text inputs with single-tap choices, sliders, or toggles. If text is unavoidable, one field per screen.

- **Shrink choices.** 3–6 options per screen; use images or icons; ensure options are mutually exclusive.

- **Keep copy scannable.** 1–2 short lines max per question. Use helper text only when it changes the answer.

### Email & Data Capture

- **Make email optional and valuable.** Label clearly (“Optional”) and offer a specific incentive (e.g., “10% off now”). Place it after value is built (last or second-to-last step). Make the email question optional in [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings) and clearly indicate this choice to the user.

- **Give results even without email.** Gate extras (PDF routine, detailed guide, bundle pricing) behind email — not the core results.

- **Use trust cues at friction points.** Near the email step: “No spam, unsubscribe anytime,” privacy link, and social proof (“2,184 shoppers helped this month”).


!!! tip "Tip: Email Question"

    Consider the value of obtaining a participant's email. Assess whether the potential long-term benefits, like building your email list for targeted marketing, outweigh the immediate goal of quiz completion.

### UX & Quiz page

- **Show progress the way humans parse it.** “3 of 6” beats “50%.” Keep the total constant (no adding hidden steps mid-flow).

- **Pause competing popups.** While quiz is active, hide newsletter/chat popups and overlays. Resume them after completion.

- **Reduce visual noise.** On the quiz page, hide sticky headers/footers, promo banners, and auto-carousels that steal focus.

- **Result screen matters.** Render the top picks instantly; place secondary content later on the page.

- **Accessibility = completions.** Proper labels, focus order, visible focus state, sufficient contrast. Screen-reader friendly progress (“Step 2 of 6”).


## Step 3: A/B Test

Create a variation of your quiz with the implemented changes, such as making it shorter and adjusting the approach to collecting emails.

Run both the original and the modified quizzes simultaneously to see which version has a higher completion rate.

!!! tip

    Check our [How to A/B Test You Quiz](/how-to-guides/ab-test-quiz/) article for instructions.

## Step 4: Continous Improvement

Use the Product Recommendation Quiz [analytics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#analytics) or [GA4](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) to review the performance of both quiz versions.

Pay attention to the completion rates and participant feedback to understand what works best.

Continuously refine your quiz based on these insights, aiming for an optimal balance between information collection and user experience.

---

By closely monitoring in-app drop-off metrics and experimenting with different quiz formats and strategies, you can improve quiz completion rates.

# Product Quiz Metrics: What to Track to Convert Better

Data from product recommendation quizzes can significantly enhance your conversion rates. Understanding which metrics to track and how to interpret them is key to optimizing your quizzes for better performance. 

Here’s a guide on the most critical quiz metrics and how they can drive better conversion outcomes.

![product quiz metrics: what to track to convert better image1](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Quiz-Metrics.png)

## Where to find the data?

### ➡️ Quiz Metrics

All the information gathered by your RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz can be found in the [Metrics/Analytics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/) panel. 

- The [Responses](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) section shows all the quiz responses organized by date/timestamp. Click on a date to open a specific response. Each response shows what choices the customer made, which products were upvoted or excluded, which products were recommended, and what customer tags carried out until the results page.

    ![quiz builder metrics responses](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_responses.png)

    ![quiz builder metrics responses details](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_responses_sample1.png)

- The [Analytics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#analytics) section provides graphs on quiz engagement, conversion rate, and revenue. You can analyze the data by date and compare it to past periods or other quizzes.

    ![quiz builder metrics analytics](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_metrics_analytics.png)

- The [Drop Off](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#drop-off) section displays a breakdown percentage of users leaving certain questions in your quiz. The data is shown in a table format.

    ![quiz builder metrics drop off](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_metrics_analytics_dropoff.png)


###➡️ Download Raw Data

You can analyze the data there or [download all the responses as a .CSV file](/how-to-guides/download-quiz-responses/) and analyze it in Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel.

![quiz builder metrics responses download](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_responses_exportCSV.png)

###➡️ Advanced Tracking

Additionally, RevenueHunt app offers integrations with [Google Analytics](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) and [Meta Pixel](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/) where additional information like click rate per choice, traffic source or revenue can be collected and measured.


## What to analyze and how to improve?

### 1️⃣ Customer Engagement
 

**Quiz Starts and Completions**

Tracking the number of quiz starts and responses/completions is fundamental. High start rates indicate good initial engagement, but the completion rate is what truly matters for conversions. If you notice a drop-off between starts and completions, it might be time to refine your quiz flow or simplify the questions.

![quiz builder metrics analytics starts and completions](/images/cs_track_metrics_starts_responses.png)

!!! note

    `Quiz Starts` refers to the number of people who have engaged with the quiz by passing the first slide. 
    
    `Quiz Responses` refers to the number of people who have completed the quiz, aka. reached the quiz results page. 
    
    If the customer closes the quiz before the results page, this will not be counted as a response/completion.

**Completion Rate**

!!! info "Completion Rate Formula"  

    **Completion Rate (%)** = (Number of Quiz Completions ÷ Number of Quiz Starts) × 100


`Completion Rate` is the percentage of people who have engaged with the quiz and completed it. The completion rate is a clear indicator of how engaging and user-friendly your quiz is. A higher completion rate suggests that users find the quiz relevant and easy to navigate, which increases the likelihood of them following through to purchase recommendations. The aim is to keep the completion rate as high as possible, around 90-100%.

![quiz builder metrics analytics completion rate](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/images/manual_quizbuilder_metrics_analytics_comprate.png)

**Drop-off Points / Drop-off Rate**

Identifying where users drop off in your quiz can provide insights into potential friction points. Are users abandoning the quiz at a specific question or step? Use this data to adjust those points, making them more intuitive or engaging.

![quiz builder metrics drop off](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_metrics_analytics_dropoff.png)


!!! note
    The `drop-off rate` is measured based on events, which are triggered whenever someone starts a quiz. Some of these start events can be blocked by adblocking plugins in browsers. If you see a difference between the number of quiz starts and the dropoff rate, that is because the number of quiz starts in the analytics tab is automatically adjusted by the algorithm to filter in also the starts blocked by the ad blocker plugin.

| Issue                          | Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Low Quiz Starts**            | - **Make the quiz more visible.** Publish the quiz in multiple ways on your website, send a link to the quiz in your newsletter, or post a link on social media. <br> - **Promote the quiz.** Check [this article](/customer-success/how-to-get-more-quiz-engagement/) for great advice on how to increase your quiz starts. <br> - **Run ads to increase quiz popularity.** If using GA4, check the best traffic sources for your quiz and invest more in them. |
| **Low Completion Rate / High Drop Off** | - **Make the quiz shorter, max. 5-6 questions.** Customers are likely losing attention. <br> - **Add more visuals to the quiz.** Turn multiple-choice questions into picture questions. Add images and videos to your quiz. Visual quizzes have a much higher completion rate than pure text-based ones. <br> - **Check your mandatory questions.** Perhaps customers don’t want to leave their phone number, name, or email. You can make any question optional in [Question Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings). <br> - **Add personal data questions towards the end of the quiz.** Customers are more likely to stay and leave their data while already invested in the quiz. |


### 2️⃣ Revenue
 

**Carts Count and Total Carts Value**

Tracking how many users proceed to cart after completing the quiz can help you gauge the effectiveness of your product recommendations. A high cart count and total cart value indicate that the recommended products resonate well with the users.


![quiz builder metrics analytics carts count and value](/images/cs_track_metrics_number_carts.png)
![quiz builder metrics analytics carts count and value](/images/cs_track_metrics_tot_carts_value.png)

**Average Cart Value**

!!! info "Average Cart Value Formula"  
    
    **Average Cart Value** = Total Carts Value ÷ Carts Count

Understanding the average value of products in the carts can help you assess the monetary impact of your quiz. This metric is crucial for evaluating the overall financial performance and can guide you in setting appropriate pricing strategies.

![quiz builder metrics analytics average carts](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/images/manual_quizbuilder_metrics_analytics_avgcarts.png)

**Number of Orders and Total Orders Value**

For a more direct measure of conversion, track the number of orders placed and their total value, allowing you to directly correlate quiz engagement with sales performance.

!!! warning "Connect your quiz to Shopify Customers and Shopify Revenue Reports"

    Connect your quiz to [Shopify Customers](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-shopify-customers/) (and [Shopify Revenue Reports](/how-to-guides/track-quiz-revenue/?h=shopify+revenue#activate-shopify-revenue-report)) to track the number of orders and their total value.

![quiz builder metrics analytics number of orders and total orders value](/images/cs_track_metrics_orders.png)

**Average Order Value**

!!! info "Average Order Value Formula"  
    
    **Average Order Value** = Total Orders Value ÷ Number of Orders


Monitoring the average order value post-quiz completion provides insights into the spending behavior of your users. It helps in understanding whether the quiz is effectively driving higher-value purchases. By using RevnueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz in your store you should expect the AOV to increase by 20%.

**Conversion Rate**

!!! info "Conversion Rate Formula"  

    **Conversion Rate (%)** = (Number of Purchases after Quiz Completion ÷ Total Number of Quiz Completions) × 100


To measure the conversion rate of your quiz, track the number of users who complete the quiz and proceed to make a purchase, then calculate the percentage of these users relative to the total number of quiz completions. This metric is essential because it reveals how effectively the quiz drives sales, aiding in optimizing the quiz design and marketing strategies to maximize revenue.  By using a RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz in your store you should expect conversion rates bumped up from 2% to 5%.

|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Customers don’t add products to cart**   | - Check if the quiz returns recommendations. <br> - Check your quiz [checkout settings](/how-to-guides/change-checkout-settings/). <br> - **Limit the number of recommended products.** A good product selector should recommend only one product that matches all the customer criteria or one product per routine step (in case of beauty shops). <br> - Make the call-to-action buttons more visible by styling them. <br> - Offer a discount or a coupon code. |

This provides more insight into who the customers are and how they interact with the quiz. 

 

**Recommendation Analysis**

Delve into why specific products or routines were recommended most often. This helps in fine-tuning your recommendation algorithms. Analyzing individual responses allows you to understand customer preferences better and adjust your product catalog accordingly.

**Product and Slot Blocks**

Evaluate the performance of product and slot blocks within the quiz. Ensure that the products being recommended are aligned with user preferences and catch their attention. This granular analysis can lead to better-targeted recommendations, improving user satisfaction and conversion rates.

Identify which recommended products are being purchased most often. This metric helps you understand the effectiveness of your recommendations in driving sales. Emphasize these high-performing products in future quizzes and promotional campaigns.

**Least Purchased Products**

Determine which products are being recommended but not purchased. Investigate potential reasons for low conversions, such as pricing, product appeal, or placement within the quiz. Adjust your strategy to either improve the attractiveness of these products or replace them with alternatives.

| **Customers get empty recommendations**          | - Check if your Results Page has a Product Block or a Slot Block to show the products. <br> - Check if you’ve linked products or collections to choices in the quiz. <br> - Check if you’re not excluding too many products from choices.                                                                                                |

|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **I don’t know who my customers are**      | - Analyze customer quiz responses in the [Responses](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) panel. <br> - Use [Customer Tags](/how-to-guides/use-customer-tags/) to mark certain quiz choices to help you define the customer group. For example, if you ask your customer an age question, you can tag them based on their age group. You can do the same with other quiz questions, and soon you’ll be able to identify the most popular tags and buyer personas.                                                                                                         |
| **I don’t know what my customers buy**     | - Check your Orders and Revenue tracking tools to see the most frequently purchased items. <br> - Analyze the product recommendations given in the quiz and cross-reference them with actual purchases to see what recommended products are being bought. <br> - Use post-purchase surveys to confirm why customers chose certain products.                                                                                                                                                |
| **I don’t know how to make customers purchase regularly** | - Use [Customer Tags](/how-to-guides/use-customer-tags/) to mark certain quiz choices to help you define the customer group. You can then create a marketing campaign in your CRM platform to target that specific group of customers. Highly segmented campaigns tend to have higher returns. <br> - Offer loyalty programs or subscription services to encourage repeat purchases. <br> - Send personalized follow-up emails with product recommendations based on previous purchases and quiz responses. <br> - Introduce time-limited discounts or special offers to incentivize repeat purchases. |

## How to use Customer Tags?
Imagine a haircare store that offers a wide range of products including shampoos, conditioners, hair treatments, styling products, and more. 
The store uses the RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz to help customers find the best products based on their hair type, concerns, and goals. 
Here’s how they can use customer tags for a segmented marketing campaign in Klaviyo:
### 1️⃣ Create the Quiz
Create a quiz with questions about hair type (e.g., curly, straight, wavy), hair concerns (e.g., dandruff, dryness, frizz), and hair goals (e.g., volume, shine, repair). Make sure to add an email question as the last slide.
![how to use customer tags in product quizzes to maximize sales](/images/cs_customer_tags_example_quizbuilder.png)   
!!! example "Sample Quiz"

### 2️⃣ Create and Link Customer Tags to Choices
As customers answer these questions, assign relevant tags such as *“Curly Hair,”* *“Dry Hair,”* *“Volume,”* *“Anti-Frizz,”* and *“Repair”* to the choices in the quiz. 
![how to use customer tags in product quizzes to maximize sales](/images/cs_customer_tags_example_hair_tags.png)
Check the [Choice Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings) section to add customer tags to choices.
### 3️⃣ Connect Quiz to Klaviyo
Connect the quiz to Klaviyo following [these instructions](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/).
Once the quiz is connected, customer tags from the RevenueHunt app are automatically sent to Klaviyo along with customer choices and recommendations. This allows Klaviyo to receive and store tags linked to each customer profile.
### 4️⃣ Create Segments in Klaviyo
In Klaviyo, create segments based on the tags.
![how to use customer tags in product quizzes to maximize sales](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kalviyo-segement-768x450.png)

### 5️⃣ Design Tailored Email Campaigns
Create [email flows/campaigns](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002774932) specifically tailored to each segment in Kalviyo. When designing tailored email campaigns, it’s all about crafting messages that really speak to each customer segment’s unique needs and preferences.
Start by digging into the data from your customer tags to understand what makes each group tick. Create content that addresses their specific interests and personalize your subject lines and email bodies to make them feel valued. Plan your campaign schedule carefully to keep people engaged without overwhelming them, and use automation to send timely, relevant emails based on their behavior.
For example:
- **Curly Hair Segment**: Send emails featuring products designed for curly hair, such as curl-enhancing shampoos and conditioners, and styling creams. Include tips for maintaining curly hair and exclusive offers on curl care bundles.
- **Dry Hair Segment**: Send emails promoting moisturizing shampoos, conditioners, and deep-conditioning treatments. Share tips on how to combat dry hair and offer discounts on hydrating product sets.
- **Volume Goal Segment**: Highlight volumizing shampoos, conditioners, and styling products. Include styling tips for achieving more volume and special promotions on volume-boosting kits.
- **Anti-Frizz Segment**: Focus on anti-frizz serums, creams, and treatments. Provide advice on managing frizz and offer deals on anti-frizz collections.

# How to A/B Test Your Product Recommendation Quiz

A/B testing, or split testing, allows you to compare two versions of your quizzes to see which one performs better. 

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up A/B testing manually using your ability to create, duplicate, and edit quizzes in the RevenueHunt app.

Ensure you have:

- Access to the RevenueHunt app where you can create and edit quizzes.
- Basic understanding of [how to publish quizzes](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz/) on your website.
- Access to your website’s backend or a platform that allows you to edit HTML/JavaScript for traffic distribution (optional for advanced routing).
- Analytics tools or integration such as  [Google Analytics](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) or [Meta Pixel](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/). to measure quiz performance.

## Step 1: Create Two Versions of Your Quiz

- **Design Your Original Quiz**: Create your quiz (Version A) in the RevenueHunt app, focusing on the content and design that you currently believe will perform best.
- **Duplicate and Modify for Version B**: Use the duplication feature on the dashboard to make a copy of Version A. Alter one or more elements (e.g., title, color scheme, question order) to create Version B. Ensure only one key variable is different to accurately measure the effect of that change. Remember to publish the changes with the top-right Publish button.

## Step 2: Publish Both Versions on Your Website

Deploying both versions of your quiz on your website can be done through simple or advanced methods, depending on your ability to modify your site’s code and the level of precision you require in your A/B testing.

### No Coding Solution: Basic A/B Testing
For straightforward A/B testing, we recommend publishing each version of the quiz on separate pages within your store. This approach does not require any coding:

- **Inline Quiz on a New Page**: Create a new page for each version of the quiz (Version A and Version B). Follow the [Inline Quiz on a New Page](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-inline/#embedding-an-inline-quiz-on-a-new-page) publishing instructions to embed each quiz into its respective page. 

This method allows you to directly link to each quiz version from different parts of your website or through external marketing channels.

### Coding Solution: Advanced A/B Testing
If you’re aiming for a more sophisticated A/B testing setup that involves randomizing which quiz version a visitor sees, you’ll need some coding:

- **Link Popup**: Implement a Link Popup method by creating a single entry point (like a button or link) that dynamically directs visitors to either Version A or Version B of the quiz. You will need to work with a developer to program the logic that decides which link to the quiz is shown to each visitor. Follow the [Link Popup Publishing Instructions](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-link/) for detailed steps on how to implement this solution.

By choosing the appropriate method based on your needs and capabilities, you can effectively publish and test different quiz versions on your website to gather insights and improve engagement.

## Step 3: Evenly Distribute Traffic Between Quizzes

To manually distribute traffic:

- For Basic Routing: Use two separate URLs for each quiz version and direct users randomly via your website’s links or promotions.
- For Advanced Routing: Implement a JavaScript snippet or server-side logic on your landing page that randomly serves Version A or Version B of the quiz to each new visitor.

## Step 4: Track and Analyze Results

- **Set Up Analytics**: Ensure each quiz version has tracking set up. By default, we track the quiz starts, completions, conversion rate, and drop-off in the [Metrics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/) panel. For more advanced analytics, you can connect your quizzes to [Google Analytics](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) or [Meta Pixel](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/).
- **Analyze Performance**: After a significant amount of traffic has interacted with both versions, analyze the data to identify which version achieved better performance based on your predefined goals (e.g., higher completion rates).

## Step 5: Implement Improvements

Based on the analysis, decide which version of the quiz is more effective. Implement the winning elements in your standard quiz and consider new variables to test in future A/B testing cycles.

## Tips for Effective A/B Testing

- Test one variable at a time to understand its impact clearly.
- Ensure you have a statistically significant sample size before drawing conclusions.

A/B testing for quizzes is entirely feasible with the RevenueHunt app. By following this guide, you can uncover valuable insights into what resonates with your audience, leading to better engagement and conversion rates over time.

    2. Our theme editor allows you to pick one of our multiple color palettes, choose from multiple fonts and add a default background image to your quiz.
        ![manual_quizbuilder_quizdesign_edittheme](/images/manual_quizbuilder_quizdesign_edittheme.png){width="300"}
        `Background` - Opens a color menu that allows you to change the color of the quiz background. You can add a custom color by pasting the #number of the color (for example, #ecb3b3).

    !!! tip "Background image Tip"
        Our app uses a **responsive design**, meaning your quiz will adjust to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile). Because of this, **background images may crop or scale differently depending on the device**.
        To ensure your background looks great across all devices, we recommend:
        ✅ Use high-resolution images of **max. 1000px x 1000px size**.
        ✅ Avoid images with text — it might be cut off or obscured
        ✅ If needed, keep important elements (like logos or text) centered
        ✅ Use soft, neutral backgrounds that won’t clash with quiz content
        ✅ Test your quiz on different devices to see how the image behaves
        Remember, simpler is often better for responsive backgrounds!     
    !!! tip "Higher resolution images"
        You can use [Quiz Design > Custom CSS console](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/#custom-css) to upload a background image for the whole quiz in a desired resolution.

            .lq-bg-img, .lq-bg-img-only, .widget .lq-bg-img, .widget .lq-bg-img-only {
                background-image: url('https://your-image-url.com/image-mobile.jpg');
            }
        }
        ```

    !!! tip "Uploaded image Tip"
        Our app uses a **responsive design**, meaning your quiz will adjust to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile). Because of this, **uploaded images may crop or scale differently depending on the device**.
        To ensure your uploaded images look great across all devices, we recommend:
        ✅ Use high-resolution images of **max. 1000px x 1000px size**.
        ✅ Avoid images with text — it might be cut off or obscured
        ✅ If needed, keep important elements (like logos or text) centered
        ✅ Use soft, neutral backgrounds that won’t clash with quiz content
        ✅ Test your quiz on different devices to see how the image behaves
        Remember, simpler is often better for responsive backgrounds!     
    !!! tip "Higher resolution images"
        You can use [Quiz Design > Custom CSS console](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/#custom-css) to upload  a background/split image for the whole quiz in a desired resolution.
        Sample code:
        ```html	
        .lq-bg-img, .lq-bg-img-only, .widget .lq-bg-img, .widget .lq-bg-img-only {
            background-image: url('https://your-image-url.com/image.jpg');

    ![how to add a discount example](/images/how_to_add_a_discount_example.png){width="300"}
    This guide explains how to implement Discount Coupons for Checkout with the RevenueHunt app.
## Set Up Discount on the Results Page
    **Step 1: Generate a Discount Code**
    If your store is built on WooCommerce, you’ll need [the Advanced Coupons for WooCommerce plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-coupons-for-woocommerce-free/) for this to work.
    Create a coupon code, then navigate to the URL Coupons section. Make sure the Redirect To URL points to your cart page. Copy the URI (it’s the end part of the URL, excluding the https + your domain name):
    ![how to add discount woo step 1](/images/how_to_add_discount_woo_step_1.png)
    Example: if the Coupon URL which appears is `https://yourdomain.com/coupon/codexyz/`, then the part you need to copy is `/coupon/codexyz/`. 
    **Step 2: Configure Your Discount Code on the Results Page**
    Then in the Product Recommendation Quiz, go to the [Results Page Settings > Checkout Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) and paste the copied URI in the `Cart URL` field.
    ![how to add discount woo step 2](/images/how_to_add_discount_woo_step_2.png)
    This will apply the coupon code when your customers finish the quiz and proceed to cart, then it will redirect them automatically to the cart page in your store.
    **Step 3: Publish Changes**
    1. Click the top-right [`Publish` button](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) to apply your changes to the live quiz/preview.
    **Alternatively**
    Your developer can also add a discount code to the results page using custom JavaScript code added to the Results page. Check out [this article](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) for more information.

        ```
        to add a custom coupon or a discount code to the results page and apply it to all the products. Note, that this coupon code needs to be first set up in your store.

[Multiple Results Pages Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#multiple-results-pages-settings) screen will appear and a second Results page will be added.
        ![how to add discount multiple result pages](/images/manual_quizbuilder_resultspage_settings_multipleresultspages.png){width="300"}

## Customization Examples
### Example 1: Trigger functions from an element in the results page
    You can do it two ways: 
    1. Create an element in the result page and add the `onclick` functionality later via the Custom Javascript.
        !!! example "Add the `onclick` functionality via the Custom Javascript."
            ```html
            <!-- In Result page in a HTML block -->
            <!-- add a HTML element such as -->
            <a id="special_retake_quiz">Click here to retake the quiz</a>
            ```
            ```html
            /* In the Custom Javascript section */
            // get the element
            var element = document.getElementById("special_retake_quiz");
            // add the onclick function to the element
            element.onclick = function() {
                prq.retakeQuiz();
            }
            ```
    2. Or you can create the element in the Custom Javascript section with an `onclick` event first and then inject it in the results page.
        !!! example "Create the element with an `onclick` event first and then inject it in the results page."
            ```html
            /* In the Custom Javascript section */
            // create the element
            var element = document.createElement("a");
            element.innerHTML = "Click here to retake the quiz"
            // add the onclick function to the element
            element.onclick = function() {
                prq.retakeQuiz();
            }
            // get element that we are going to append in the result
            // in this case at the end of the first block
            var destination_element = document.querySelectorAll(".lq-block")[0];
            destination_element.appendChild(element);
            ```
    You can do it two ways: 
    1. Create an element in the result page and add the `onclick` functionality later via the Custom Javascript.
        !!! example "Add the `onclick` functionality via the Custom Javascript."
            ```html
            <!-- In Result page in a HTML block -->
            <!-- add a HTML element such as -->
            <a id="special_retake_quiz">Click here to retake the quiz</a>
            ```
            ```html
            /* In the Custom Javascript section */
            // get the element
            var element = document.getElementById("special_retake_quiz");
            // add the onclick function to the element
            element.onclick = function() {
                prq.retakeQuiz();
            }
            ```
    2. Or you can create the element in the Custom Javascript section with an `onclick` event first and then inject it in the results page.
        !!! example "Create the element with an `onclick` event first and then inject it in the results page."
            ```html
            /* In the Custom Javascript section */
            // create the element
            var element = document.createElement("a");
            element.innerHTML = "Click here to retake the quiz"
            // add the onclick function to the element
            element.onclick = function() {
                prq.retakeQuiz();
            }
            // get element that we are going to append in the result
            // in this case at the end of the first block
            var destination_element = document.querySelectorAll(".lq-block")[0];
            destination_element.appendChild(element);
            ```
### Example 2: Insert calculations
You can display the information you have gathered throughout the quiz and mash it up however you want. For example, you could create a BMI (body mass index) calculator the following way.
!!! example "Create a BMI calculator"
    ```html
    <!-- In Result page in a HTML block -->
    <!-- add an HTML element such as -->
    <div id="body_mass_index_calculation"></div>
    ```
    ```javascript
    /* In the Custom Javascript section */
    // get the element
    var element = document.getElementById("body_mass_index_calculation");
    // get the values of the slides
    var weight = prq.getSlideValue("rgiq0oE");
    var height = prq.getSlideValue("0Mi2qLN");
    // instead of using prq.getSlideValue you could do the same with this code:
    /*
    var slide_weight = prq.quiz.attributes.slides.data.find(s => s.id === "rgiq0oE");
    var slide_height = prq.quiz.attributes.slides.data.find(s => s.id === "0Mi2qLN");
    var weight = slide_weight.attributes.values[0];
    var height = slide_height.attributes.values[0];
    */
    // calculate the Body Mass Index
    var bmi = weight / (height * height);
    // insert the calculation on the element in the result page
    element.innerHTML = bmi.toFixed(2); 
    ```

    It is possible to make the quiz multiple choice questions select all preceding answers and none of the answers with custom JavaScript code. You will be able to use it as long as there is only one choice that contains the word "All" and one that contains the word "None".  It doesn't matter the order or the question number.
    ??? example "Select all, select none"
        This code may require adjustments by a developer.  Use it as an example only.
        ```javascript
        // Initializes an object to hold the current slide's state, ensuring it doesn't overwrite if already exists.
        var prq = prq || {
          currentSlide: {
            values: [], // An array to store the values (identifiers) of selected choices.
          },
        };
        // Selects all elements with class `.lq-choice` as the choices available on the current slide/view.
        const choices = document.querySelectorAll(".lq-choice");
        // Retrieves the currently selected choice values from the global state.
        var values = prq.currentSlide.values;
        // Iterates over each choice and attaches a click event listener to handle selection/deselection.
        choices.forEach((selector) => {
          selector.addEventListener("click", function () {
            refresh(this.id); // Calls the refresh function on click, passing the clicked choice's ID.
          });
        });
        // Defines the logic to update choice selections based on user interaction.
        function refresh(id) {
          var choice = document.getElementById(id); // Retrieves the DOM element for the clicked choice.
          // Logic to deselect a choice if it's already selected.
          if (valuesIncludes(values, choice)) {
            values = removeChoice(values, choice);
          } 
          // Logic to select all choices except "none" when "all" is clicked.
          else if (isAll(choice)) {
            const cs = [...choices].filter((c) => !isNone(c));
            values = cs.map((c) => choiceId(c));
          } 
          // Logic to handle "none" selection, deselecting all other choices or selecting none only.
          else if (isNone(choice)) {

    It is possible to make the quiz multiple choice questions select all preceding answers and none of the answers with custom JavaScript code. You will be able to use it as long as there is only one choice that contains the word "All" and one that contains the word "None".  It doesn't matter the order or the question number.

### Example 4: Redirect to Translated Product URL
    Our application syncs only the base products from your store. Products translated into other languages won't have unique IDs for sync. Although you can change the quiz language, product names and descriptions will display in the original language. 
    A workaround for this could be creating quizzes in different languages and redirecting users to the translated product pages with JavaScript. We explain this approach in [this article](/how-to-guides/change-quiz-language/#step-3-redirect-to-translated-product-url).

# How to Add Product Metafields/Attributes

This article explains how to add product metafields/attributes to products on your quiz's results page.

--- WooCommerce Specific Content ---

[Attributes](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-product-taxonomies/#product-attributes) in Woocommerce are used by stores to display specific product properties that aren't shown by default on e-commerce platforms. For instance, in Germany, it's required to show the "grundpreis" or `per 100ml` price for cosmetic products. Attributes make this possible.
    If you're looking to import product attributes from your store into the Product Recommendation Quiz to display them on your quiz's results page, follow the steps outlined below:
    **Step 1: Enable Attributes Display**
    First, enable the display of attributes for individual products:
    1. Navigate to your [Results Page Settings > Basic](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#basic-settings).
    2. Open the `Individual Product Settings` section.
    3. Activate the `show metafields` toggle.
    **Step 2: Open App Settings**
    Open [App Settings > Catalogue](/reference/app-settings/#catalogue) to access the settings to manage your catalog.
    **Step 3: Select  Attributes**
    Activate the `Pass attribute information to result page` setting by clicking the toggle.
    ![how to add attributes woo step 1](/images/how_to_add_metafields_woo_step_1.png)
    **Step 4: Sync the Catalog**
    Update your catalog with the new attributes by triggering a [catalog sync](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/) from your dashboard.
    **Step 5: Implement Custom JavaScript on the Results Page**
    To display the metafield values on your results page, [custom JavaScript](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) is required:
    1. Your developer will need to write custom JavaScript code to render the metafield value in the desired location on the results page.
    2. This customization falls outside the support scope of our app.
    Here's a sample code that replaces the product description with the `descriptors-subtitle` metafield. This code should be added in the [Custom JavaScript](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) input under [Results Page Settings > Advanced Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#advanced-settings):
    ```javascript
    window.recommendedProducts = prq.recommendedProducts();
    var products = document.querySelectorAll('.lq-product');
    for (let i = 0; i < products.length; i++) {
      let id = products[i].id;
      let oneId = id.match(/^\d/) ? ("#\\3" + id.charAt(0) + " " + id.substring(1)) : "#" + id;
      let product = window.recommendedProducts.find(product => product.id === id);
      if (product.metafields['descriptors-subtitle']) {
        let toEdit = document.querySelectorAll(oneId + ' .lq-hcont');
        for (let j = 0; j < toEdit.length; j++) {
          if (!toEdit[j].hasAttribute("edited")) {
            toEdit[j].insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', '<span>' + product.metafields['descriptors-subtitle'] + '</span>');
            toEdit[j].setAttribute("edited", "true");
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    ![Implement Custom JavaScript](/images/how_to_add_metafields_step5.png)
## How to Use Metafields as Smart Collections
    You can use attributes as categories in the RevenueHunt app for WooCommerce.
    To do that: 
    1. Open [App Settings > Catalogue](/reference/app-settings/#catalogue) to access the settings to manage your catalog.
    2. Activate the `Use attributes as categories` setting by clicking the toggle.
      ![how to add attributes woo step 1](/images/how_to_add_metafields_woo_step_1.png)
    3. Update your catalog with the new attributes by triggering a [catalog sync](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/) from your dashboard.
    4. Go to the [Link Collections](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/) tab in the Quiz Builder and link the attributes to a choice.
    5. Click `Publish` to save your changes.
---
Following these steps will enable you to display specific metafields on your quiz's results page, ensuring compliance with local regulations and improving your product presentations.

## Add Products via Google Merchant Center

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.289308176100626%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/5817998bfddb47c7a13d1adb28beeb05?sid=584e70a7-c306-407a-a76e-7b370108c0c8" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

This section will guide you through the process of importing your products from Google Merchant Center into your RevenueHunt quiz app.

**Step 1: Access the Success Checklist**:

1. In your RevenueHunt dashboard, look for any of these icons: ❓❗✅ 🔄
2. Click on the 🔄 icon to open the Sync section of the Success Checklist

![dashboard standalone success checklist](/images/manual_standalone_succcesschecklist.png){width="500"}

**Step 2: Navigate to Google Product Feed**:

1. In the Success Checklist, locate the `>activate Google Product Feed` option
2. Click to begin the process of connecting your Google Product Feed

![dashbaord standalone success checklist products](/images/manual_standalone_succcesschecklist_products.png){width="500"}

**Step 3: Set Up Google Product Feed**:

1. Paste your Google Product Feed (source) URL in the `Add your Google Product Feed:` field. It should be a valid Google Product Feed link that ends with `.xml`.

    ![manual_standalone_succcesschecklist_productfeed](/images/manual_standalone_succcesschecklist_productfeed.png)


    !!! warning 

        You cannot just upload any data source file to the RevenueHunt app. The file must be a **valid Google Product Feed XML file**. Check this [guide](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/12631822?hl=en) to learn more about the best practices for creating a valid Google Product Feed.
    

    !!! info "How do I find my Google Product Feed URL?"

        To find your Google Product Feed URL in Google Merchant Center:

        1. Log into your account at [https://merchants.google.com/](https://merchants.google.com/)
        2. Click `Products`, then `Manage product sources`.
        3. Click the name of your desired data source to open the data source settings.
        4. Under `Data source setup` check the `File URL` field and copy the URL.
        5. Paste the URL into the `File URL` field in the RevenueHunt app.
        6. Click `Save` to save the changes.

    !!! tip "Host the file somewhere public"

        Alternatively, you can also host your XML file somewhere public. For example:

        - Shopify (if your store is on Shopify): Go to `Settings` → `Files` in your Shopify admin. Upload `google_product_feed.xml`. Copy the URL Shopify gives you (it will look like `https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/.../google_product_feed.xml`).

        - Your own website / hosting: Upload the file via FTP, cPanel File Manager, or your CMS’s media upload.

        - Cloud storage: Use Dropbox, Google Drive (with direct link), or Amazon S3 — but make sure the link is public and ends with `.xml`.

2. Once the link is added, the app will automatically upload products and collections to your quiz account.


    !!! warning "Your Google Product Feed doesn't work?"

        First, make sure that your file is a valid Google Product Feed XML file. Review the Google [Documentation](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/12631822?hl=en) guide.

        You should also try [this validation service](https://developers.google.com/product-review-feeds/validation/) to check for problems.

        If you still have issues, please [contact our support team](/how-to-guides/contact-customer-support/) and we'll be happy to help you.


**Next Steps**:

After adding your products and collections, you can:

- [Set up product recommendations](/how-to-guides/set-up-recommendations/)
- [Customize your quiz design](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/)

# Why Products Aren't Added to the Cart?

If your products are not added to the cart, here are the most probable causes:

## Your quiz is not published on a live website

The quiz needs to be published on live website (not hidden by a “coming soon” plugin or password). 

!!! tip

    Check [this article](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz/) to learn how to publish your quiz.

## You’re using a cart drawer

Our RevenueHunt app does not integrate with drawer carts at the moment. So after the quiz is over, the quiz is adding products to the “regular” cart instead of the drawer cart in your theme.

!!! warning "Cart Drawer"

    Check this article: [How to Update Your Shopify Cart Drawer Products After the Quiz](/how-to-guides/update-shopify-cart-drawer/) 

    This guide explains:

    - How RevenueHunt quiz app adds products to the Shopify cart

    - Why the cart drawer may not update

    - What your theme editor or developer can do to fix it

Unfortunately, drawer carts are an added functionality by specific store themes, not a core Shopify feature. Because of that, we cannot integrate with all the different themes that have drawer carts at the moment. However, there are a few ways this can be solved. Check the [How to Update Your Shopify Cart Drawer Products After the Quiz article](/how-to-guides/update-shopify-cart-drawer/) for more information.

**Option 1: Configure your Shopify theme to handle cart updates**

If you configure your Shopify theme to handle cart updates, it may be possible to integrate with drawer carts directly from the quiz.
    
!!! tip

    Check [this article](/how-to-guides/update-shopify-cart-drawer/) to learn how quiz adds products to the cart and how to configure your Shopify theme to handle cart updates.

**Option 2: Send the customer to the product page**

You could, instead of adding the product to the cart, send the customer to the product page by changing the checkout settings. They will be able to add the product to the drawer cart from there.

!!! tip

    Check [this article](/how-to-guides/change-checkout-settings/) to learn how to change your checkout settings.


## Your product is a subscription product

RevenueHunt app is able to sync and recommend subscription products created with ReCharge Subscriptions for Shopify. Check [here](/how-to-guides/recommend-subscription-products/) for instructions on how to enable it.

For other subscription apps, there's a [workaround](/how-to-guides/recommend-subscription-products/#other-subscriptions) that allows you to still guide your customers towards subscription options via the RevenueHunt app.

# How to Change Checkout Settings on Your Results Page

Adjusting the checkout settings in RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz allows you to choose whether your customers will proceed to the cart, checkout or the product page from the results page. 

Follow the instructions below to change your checkout settings:

--- WooCommerce Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/f2ddc47043904e48bb08cbadc6f24233?sid=2f93b324-dc00-42ff-89cf-bd759e0f3a44" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    1. **Access Results Page Settings**: Begin by navigating to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) tab in the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/). Here, you will find a clog icon indicating the [Results Page settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/). Click this icon to proceed.
    2. **Locate Checkout Settings**: Within the settings menu, navigate to the `Basic` section, and from there, find the `Checkout Settings`. 
        ![manual_woo_quizbuilder_resultspage_checkoutsettings](/images/manual_woo_quizbuilder_resultspage_checkoutsettings.png)
    3. This is where you can customize how products are added to the cart and how customers proceed to checkout. RevenueHunt's Product Recommendation Quiz offers two primary options for managing how customers interact with products they wish to purchase:
        1. **Add Product to Cart**:
            ![how to change checkout settings add to cart](/images/how_to_change_checkout_settings_add_to_cart.png)
            - This option allows you to add selected products directly to the customer's shopping cart. It streamlines the buying process, making it easier for customers to proceed to checkout.
            - After enabling this option, you can further specify what URL customers should be sent to in the **Cart URL**:
                -  `/cart` and be directed to the shopping cart page to review their selections or if they should
                - `/checkout` and be taken directly to the checkout page, bypassing the cart. 
            This decision should align with your sales strategy and consideration of the customer's convenience.
        2. **Link to Product**:
            ![how to change checkout settings view product](/images/how_to_change_checkout_settings_view_product.png)
            - Alternatively, you might want customers to have the opportunity to view more details about a product before making a purchase. Selecting this option replaces the direct 'add to cart' action with a `view product` link.
            - When customers click on the `view product` link, they are taken to the individual product page instead of adding the item directly to their cart. This can be beneficial for providing customers with additional product information, images, and reviews that might influence their purchasing decision.
        3. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/f2ddc47043904e48bb08cbadc6f24233?sid=2f93b324-dc00-42ff-89cf-bd759e0f3a44" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

    **Link to product** - Displays a "view product" button that takes the customer to the product page. This option disables the "add to cart" feature.
    !!! tip
        If you would like to add a product to the cart you can set up your own results page in your store and send all the quiz data there with the help of our [Callback function](/how-to-guides/use-callback-function/).

## Multi-currency quizzes
    At the moment the RevenueHunt app doesn’t support multi-currency stores. We’re pulling your store’s **base currency**. Our app takes into account the original prices set up in your store. If your base currency is in USD dollars, then the US dollar prices will be the only ones synced with the app.
    If you run a multi-currency shop there's a workaround. What most customers do is show the product on the results page without the price and instead choose the checkout option to view the product. This way the customer is redirected to the product page from the result where the right price is applied.
    Follow these steps to apply this workaround:
    1. Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/).
    2. Navigate to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/).
    3. Open the [Results Page Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/).
    4. In [Basic Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#basic-settings), check the `Checkout Settings` section. Select `Link to product`.
    5. Scroll down to `Individual Product Settings`. 
    5. Search for `Show price` and click the toggle to deactivate it. 
    Now, the product price will not be shown and the customer will be redirected to the product page from the results page.

# How to Change the Language of Your Quiz

This guide will help you change the language of your quiz, translate it into different languages or set up Shopify Markets to display the quiz in different languages based on the visitor's location and language preference.

--- WooCommerce Specific Content ---

## Change Quiz Language in Settings
    1. **Open Quiz Settings**: To change the quiz language navigate to [Quiz Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/) or [`Quiz Settings -> Messages`](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#messages).
        ![how to change quiz language messages](/images/manual_quizbuilder_quizsettings_messages.png){width="300"}
    2. **Language**: Choose a language from a dropdown list to change the text on the quiz buttons and placeholders into that language.
    3. **Add your own translations**: If the desired language is not available or you prefer a different translation you can modify individual instances (such as buttons and placeholders) directly within the [Messages](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#messages) tab.
    4. **Override the translations**: Should any buttons revert to their original English translations (overriding your selected quiz language) you can manually adjust the button text in [`Quiz Builder -> Question settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).
    1. **Open Quiz Settings**: To change the quiz language navigate to [Quiz Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/) or [`Quiz Settings -> Messages`](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#messages).

## Set Up Multilingual Quizzes
    While our application currently lacks native multi-language support, there are effective workarounds to present quizzes in multiple languages.
    How does it work?
    - For now, it is possible to [create multiple quizzes](#step-1-create-quizzes-in-different-languages), each one in a different language. 
    - Then, each of these quizzes will have a **unique quiz ID**. 
    - You can embed each of these quizzes on a separate page on your store (eg quiz-en, quiz-de, quiz-fr…) or have your developer create a [script that displays the correct quiz](#step-2-display-the-correct-quiz-based-on-browser-language) popup depending on the browser language.
    - However, the main problem is that our app **can only sync the base products from your store (in the main language)**, as products translated automatically to other languages don't have unique product IDs that we could sync. So you can change the quiz language but the product names and descriptions will be shown in the original language. There are some [workarounds](#step-3-handling-product-sync-in-multilingual-stores) mentioned in the article that you can try.
    **Step 1: Create Quizzes in Different Languages**
    - **Manual Translation**: Begin by manually translating your quizzes into the desired languages. Each translated quiz will have a unique quiz ID.
    - **Quiz Settings Adjustment**: Navigate to the [Quiz Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/) to modify the language of interactive elements like buttons. However, note that questions and choices need manual translation.
    **Step 2: Display the Correct Quiz Based on Browser Language**
    Use JavaScript to show the appropriate quiz to users based on their browser's language setting. The script should:
    - Detect the browser's language.
    - Map this language to the corresponding quiz ID.
    - Update quiz links and iframes on your site to point to the correct quiz version.
    Script sample code:
    ```javascript
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
      // Check browser's preferred language (get the first two characters to ignore region)
      const language = navigator.language.substring(0,2);
      // Your mapping of languages to quiz IDs
      const quizMapping = {
        'en': 'abc123',
        'fr': 'dfg456',
        'de': 'xyz423'
      };
      // Default language (fallback to English if not found)
      const defaultQuizId = quizMapping[language] || quizMapping['en'];
      // Find all quiz links and update the href
      const quizLinks = document.querySelectorAll('a[href^="#quiz-"]');
      quizLinks.forEach(link => {
        link.setAttribute('href', '#quiz-' + defaultQuizId);
      });
      // Find all iframes with quiz URLs and update the src attribute and the data-url attribute of the parent div
      const quizIframes = document.querySelectorAll('iframe[src^="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/"]');
      quizIframes.forEach(iframe => {
        const newSrc = iframe.src.replace(/quiz\/\w+/, 'quiz/' + defaultQuizId);
        iframe.src = newSrc;
        // If the parent div has the data-url attribute, update it as well
        const parentDiv = iframe.parentElement;
        if (parentDiv && parentDiv.hasAttribute('data-url')) {
          const newDataUrl = parentDiv.getAttribute('data-url').replace(/quiz\/\w+/, 'quiz/' + defaultQuizId);
          parentDiv.setAttribute('data-url', newDataUrl);
        }
      });
    });
    ```
    !!! warning
        Make sure that you don’t publish two quizzes on the same page, as this may lead to unwanted behavior.
    **Step 3: Redirect to Translated Product URL**
    Our application syncs only the base products from your store. Products translated into other languages won't have unique IDs for sync. Although you can change the quiz language, product names and descriptions will be displayed in the original language. 
    A workaround for this could be creating quizzes in different languages and redirecting users to the translated product pages with [JavaScript](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/).
    1. Instead of adding a product to cart, you can change the [checkout settings](/how-to-guides/change-checkout-settings/) to `link to product` and point customers to the translated product page.
    2. By default, the customer will be redirected to the original product URL, but you can force an automatic URL change via JavaScript. 
    3. For example, you can tell the Results Page to automatically change all the links from this `https://www.example.com/products/productA` to this `https://www.example.com/en/products/productA` This way your customers will be automatically redirected to the translated product page.
    4. To redirect to an English translation of a product, one can use:
            ```javascript
            let shopURL = "https://www.example.com";
            var links = document.querySelectorAll(".lq-product a");
            for (let i = 0; i < links.length; i++) {
            var href = links[i].href;
            links[i].href = href.replace(shopURL,shopURL+"/en");
            }
            ```
    5. Make sure to replace the `https://www.example.com` with your store URL and change the `shopURL+"/en"` to the language code you have set up in your store (for example, `shopURL+"/fr"` for French).

      };
      // Default language (fallback to English if not found)

      // Find all quiz links and update the href
      const quizLinks = document.querySelectorAll('a[href^="#quiz-"]');
      quizLinks.forEach(link => {
        link.setAttribute('href', '#quiz-' + defaultQuizId);
      });
      // Find all iframes with quiz URLs and update the src attribute and the data-url attribute of the parent div
      const quizIframes = document.querySelectorAll('iframe[src^="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/"]');
      quizIframes.forEach(iframe => {
        const newSrc = iframe.src.replace(/quiz\/\w+/, 'quiz/' + defaultQuizId);
        iframe.src = newSrc;
        // If the parent div has the data-url attribute, update it as well
        const parentDiv = iframe.parentElement;
        if (parentDiv && parentDiv.hasAttribute('data-url')) {
          const newDataUrl = parentDiv.getAttribute('data-url').replace(/quiz\/\w+/, 'quiz/' + defaultQuizId);
          parentDiv.setAttribute('data-url', newDataUrl);

    - Update quiz links and iframes on your site to point to the correct quiz version.
    Script sample code:
    ```javascript
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
      // Check browser's preferred language (get the first two characters to ignore region)
      const language = navigator.language.substring(0,2);
      // Your mapping of languages to quiz IDs
      const quizMapping = {
        'en': 'abc123',
        'fr': 'dfg456',
        'de': 'xyz423'
      };
      // Default language (fallback to English if not found)
      const defaultQuizId = quizMapping[language] || quizMapping['en'];
      // Find all quiz links and update the href
      const quizLinks = document.querySelectorAll('a[href^="#quiz-"]');
      quizLinks.forEach(link => {
        link.setAttribute('href', '#quiz-' + defaultQuizId);
      });
      // Find all iframes with quiz URLs and update the src attribute and the data-url attribute of the parent div
      const quizIframes = document.querySelectorAll('iframe[src^="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/"]');
      quizIframes.forEach(iframe => {
        const newSrc = iframe.src.replace(/quiz\/\w+/, 'quiz/' + defaultQuizId);
        iframe.src = newSrc;
        // If the parent div has the data-url attribute, update it as well
        const parentDiv = iframe.parentElement;
        if (parentDiv && parentDiv.hasAttribute('data-url')) {
          const newDataUrl = parentDiv.getAttribute('data-url').replace(/quiz\/\w+/, 'quiz/' + defaultQuizId);
          parentDiv.setAttribute('data-url', newDataUrl);
        }
      });
    });
    ```
    !!! warning
        Make sure that you don’t publish two quizzes on the same page, as this may lead to unwanted behavior.
    **Step 3: Redirect to Translated Product URL**
    Our application syncs only the base products from your store. Products translated into other languages won't have unique IDs for sync. Although you can change the quiz language, product names and descriptions will be displayed in the original language. 
    A workaround for this could be creating quizzes in different languages and redirecting users to the translated product pages with [JavaScript](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/).
    1. Instead of adding a product to cart, you can change the [checkout settings](/how-to-guides/change-checkout-settings/) to `link to product` and point customers to the translated product page.
    2. By default, the customer will be redirected to the original product URL, but you can force an automatic URL change via JavaScript. 
    3. For example, you can tell the Results Page to automatically change all the links from this `https://www.example.com/products/productA` to this `https://www.example.com/en/products/productA` This way your customers will be automatically redirected to the translated product page.
    4. To redirect to an English translation of a product, one can use:
            ```javascript
            let shopURL = "https://www.example.com";
            var links = document.querySelectorAll(".lq-product a");
            for (let i = 0; i < links.length; i++) {
            var href = links[i].href;
            links[i].href = href.replace(shopURL,shopURL+"/en");
            }
            ```
    5. Make sure to replace the `https://www.example.com` with your store URL and change the `shopURL+"/en"` to the language code you have set up in your store (for example, `shopURL+"/fr"` for French).

# How to Check Quiz Loading Speed

When integrating a quiz into your online store, it's crucial to ensure it loads efficiently to maintain a smooth user experience. If you're encountering slow loading times for your quiz, the issue might not stem from the quiz itself but from other resources on your site affecting its performance. 

This guide outlines steps to diagnose and resolve quiz loading issues by optimizing the loading process.

--- WooCommerce Specific Content ---

**Step 1: Verify Direct Quiz Link Performance**
    First, isolate the quiz from your site's environment to determine if the issue lies within the quiz or your website.
    1. **Locate Your Quiz Link**: Find the direct URL of your quiz. This can be obtained from the `Share -> External` tab of your quiz platform. 
        - The link should look something like [https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/rkHm6Y](https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/rkHm6Y) or [https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/#quiz-rkHm6Y](https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/#quiz-rkHm6Y), where `rkHm6Y` represents your unique `quiz ID`.
    2. **Test Loading Speed**: Open the direct link in a browser to see how quickly the quiz loads independently of your site. Ideally, the quiz should load in less than one second.
    If the quiz loads quickly via the direct link, the slow loading times are likely caused by other elements on your website.
    !!! tip
        Try [https://pagespeed.web.dev/](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to check the direct quiz link performance.
    ---
    **Step 2: Analyze Your Website's Loading Order**
    Investigating the loading sequence of your website's resources can help identify what's slowing down the quiz when embedded in your site.
    1. **Open Developer Tools**: Right-click on your website in the browser and select `Inspect` to open the developer tools.
    2. **Review Network and Performance**: Navigate to the `Network` or `Performance` tabs to examine which resources are loading and how long each takes.
    Look for resources that significantly delay loading times, as these are likely culprits affecting the quiz's performance on your site.
    !!! tip
        Try [https://pagespeed.web.dev/](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to check the quiz page performance.
    ---
    **Step 3: Try Direct iFrame Embedding**
    To circumvent slow loading caused by external scripts, directly embed the quiz using an iFrame.
    **Replace Embed Code**: Instead of using the standard embed code generated from the `Share` tab, which loads the quiz via a JavaScript file (embed.js), use an iFrame embed code. This allows the quiz to load independently of other scripts on your site.
    Replace this code:
    ```html
    <div class="rh-widget rh-inline" data-url="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/rkHm6Y" style="..."></div>
    ```
    With this:
    ```html
    <div class="rh-inline" data-url="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/rkHm6Y" style="..."><iframe src="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/rkHm6Y" id="DPIyZ" style="..."></iframe></div>
    ```
    This second block of code includes the quiz iFrame directly. This will start rendering the quiz before the embed.js code is loaded.
    ---
    **Step 4: Optimize Your Website's Resources**
    Consult your developer to review and optimize the loading of resources on your site. This may involve compressing images, minimizing CSS and JavaScript files, and removing unnecessary plugins or widgets. 
    **Step 1: Verify Direct Quiz Link Performance**
    First, isolate the quiz from your site's environment to determine if the issue lies within the quiz or your website.

!!! warning

    It is not possible to copy a quiz created with the legacy version of the RevenueHunt app into the new Built for Shopify version of the app.

    **Step 1: Generate Export Quiz Code**
    First, navigate to the quiz you wish to export:
    1. Go to [Quiz Settings > General](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#general).
    2. Click on **Export quiz to another store**. A popup will display a unique code.
    3. **Copy this code** immediately. It remains valid for only 1 hour.
        ![Export Quiz Step](/images/how_to_copy_the_quiz_step_1_v2.gif)
        !!! tip
            To prevent loss, save the export quiz code in a text file.
    **Step 2: Log in to the Other Store**
    Ensure you're logged into the destination store:
    1. Log in to the new store's Shopify account in an Incognito/Private browsing mode. This way you can avoid being logged into multiple accounts on the same browser and prevent caching issues.
    2. Open the RevenueHunt app from the store's dashboard.
    **Step 3: Import the Quiz**
    Finally, import the quiz into your new store:
    1. In the RevenueHunt app, navigate to the [Dashboard](/reference/dashboard/).
    2. Click on the [New Quiz](/reference/dashboard/#new-quiz) option.
    3. Choose **import a quiz from another store** and paste the previously generated code.
        ![Import Quiz Step](/images/how_to_copy_the_quiz_step_3.gif)
    After completing these steps, the imported quiz will appear in your dashboard with a `(copy)` suffix in its name.
## Changing Domains
Follow these steps if you plan to change the domain on which the RevenueHunt app is installed.
    If you’re only changing the domain name (from `example.com` to `example-two.com`) and NOT changing the WordPress account the process shouldn’t disturb the RevenueHunt app and your quizzes. You can do so safely.
    When changing the domain accounts in WordPress, you’ll have to copy your quiz from the old domain to the new one first. [This article](#how-to-copy-the-quiz-from-one-store-to-another) explains how to do that. You may need to link your products to choices again, as they will have different product IDs in your new store. Make sure you’re **not** logged into two WordPress accounts at the same time on the same browser. This may cause caching issues. Instead, use Incognito / Private browsing for the second account.
    If you’re only changing the domain name (from `example.com` to `example-two.com`) and NOT changing the WordPress account the process shouldn’t disturb the RevenueHunt app and your quizzes. You can do so safely.

Make sure you’re **not** logged into two BigCommerce accounts at the same time on the same browser. This may cause caching issues. Instead, use Incognito / Private browsing for the second account.
    Standalone solution is independent of your domain and can be used on multiple domains simultaneously. Make sure to change your product links in your in-app [Catalogue](/reference/dashboard/#__tabbed_3_5) or Google Product Feed.
If you have any issues or doubts about changing domains, please [contact support](/how-to-guides/contact-customer-support/).

## Step 3: Set up Product Recommendations
    Once you have your questions, you'll have to link products to choices to show recommendations to the customer.
    1. **Go to Link Products/Collections/Choice Settings tab**: In the Quiz Builder, select a choice and go to [Link Products](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/)/ [Link Collections](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/) / [Choice Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings) tab.

    3. **Edit the Results Page**: Go to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) tab and edit the content. You can change the number of recommended products in the [Product Block settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings).
    ??? question "How do I get the right recommendations?"
        Our product recommendation algorithm works like a voting system:
        - Products are linked to each choice
        - When a customer picks a choice, all linked products receive one vote
        - After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted products sorted by the number of votes
        - If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty
        - If there's a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the order of products.
        If you want to make the results ultra-precise, you can also:
        - Limit the recommendations to only show products that received X votes or more in the [Results Page settings](/how-to-guides/only-recommend-products-with-minimum-votes/).
        - Use [Exclusions](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/#understanding-inclusion-and-exclusion) to make sure that unwanted products are not shown (even if they were upvoted in another choice earlier).

## Styling Quiz Text
    You can use [Markdown Language](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/) for basic styling of text in the quiz. 
    ??? question "What is Markdown Languge?"
        Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters, like `#` or `*`.
    If you need to include additional styling and elements in your questions, choices, and results page, you can do so using Markdown Language.

    - **Text Styling**
        ```html
        *italic text*  
        **bold text**  
        ***italic & bold text***  
        ```

        ```
    If you want to change the font or the color of certain texts or whole paragraphs, you may need to use [Custom CSS](#add-custom-css-code) code for that. 
    You can use [Markdown Language](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/) for basic styling of text in the quiz. 
    ??? question "What is Markdown Languge?"
        Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters, like `#` or `*`.
    If you need to include additional styling and elements in your questions, choices, and results page, you can do so using Markdown Language.
    - **Headings**
        ```html
        # H1
        ## H2
        ### H3
        ```
    - **Text Styling**
        ```html
        *italic text*  
        **bold text**  
        ***italic & bold text***  
        ```
    - **Links**
        ```html
        [link title](https://www.example.com)
        ```
    - **Images**
        ```html

## Results Page Design
The Results Page also has its own customization options. 
!!! tip
    Check [this article](/how-to-guides/edit-results-page/) to learn more about styling your results page.
In addition to the basic elements, you can set a unique background image for each result page through the [results page settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/). You can also use these settings to apply [custom JavaScript](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) to your quiz design.
If you find the default results page too restrictive, you might want to **create a custom results page** on your site and direct all quiz data to it using the [Callback Function](/how-to-guides/use-callback-function/). This function enables you to collect all quiz responses in JSON format on any page you choose.
## Customization Examples
We offer complete flexibility to developers for personalizing both the quiz and the results page. Take a look at [these examples](https://revenuehunt.com/templates/#customization) to discover the various designs you can achieve with our app using some creativity and CSS code.
## Useful CSS Codes
Here are a few popular CSS selectors and codes to style elements in the quiz:
??? example "Hide Progress Bar in the footer"
    ```html
    /* Hide Progress Bar in the footer */
    .lq-progress-box{
    display: none;
    }
    ```
??? example "Change the styles of the choices"
    ```html
    /* Change the styles of the choices */
    li.lq-choice, li.lq-choice{
    /* your CSS rules go here */
    }
    ```
??? example "Change the styles of the picture choices"
    ```html
    .lq-images li.lq-choice, .lq-images li.lq-choice{
    /* your CSS rules go here */
    }
    ```
??? example "Place the footer bar at the top, for more visibility"
    ```html
    .lq-footer, .lq-footer{
    position: absolute;
    width: 100%;
    top: 0;
    margin: 0;
    }
    ```
??? example "Make 'Back' and 'Next' arrows point left and right"
    ```html
    #nav-next .fa, #nav-back .fa {
        -webkit-transform: rotate(-90deg);
        -moz-transform: rotate(-90deg);
        -o-transform: rotate(-90deg);
        -ms-transform: rotate(-90deg);
        transform: rotate(-90deg);
    }
    ```
??? example "Adding a custom font"
    Adding a custom font (you'll have to host the font in your server). If your fonts are hosted within your Shopify store, they' may appear as a "private" fonts or hosted within a site restricted for us. If you want to use that font it'd have to be hosted elsewhere, and that way you could implement them within the quiz. Alternatively, check [Upload Google Font](#upload-a-google-font).
    ```html
    @font-face {
    font-family: "Morion";
    src: url("https://yourwebsite.com/wp-content/themes/yourtheme/fonts/Morion-Light.woff2") format("woff2");
    );
    }

    font-family: Morion, serif;
    }
    ```

    /*Hide the "add all to cart" button */
    .lq-checkout.lq-add-all-to-cart {

    }
    ```

    display: none;
    }
    ```

    It explains how to implement a price filtering feature in a quiz using WooCommerce and the Revenue Hunt Quizzes app. It covers the steps to create categories based on price ranges and how to configure the quiz to filter product recommendations accordingly.
    1. **Adding a Price Filtering Question**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/). Click `+` to add a new multiple choice question titled "What's your desired price range for your skincare routine?". Provide a price range for each option. Save the changes to ensure the question is added.
        !!! example "Price Filtering Question"
            Provide three options: 
            - Under 20 euros
            - Between 20 and 50 euros
            - Over 50 euros
            ![filter by price example](/images/how_to_filter_by_price_filter_legacy_question_example.png)
    2. **Creating Price-Based Categories in WooCommerce** : Go to **Products → Categories** in your WooCommerce admin and create a product category for each price range.
        - Name the category (for example, **Under 20 euros**).
        - Save the category.
        - Edit your products and assign them to the corresponding price category:
            - Products priced under 20 euros → assign to **Under 20 euros**.
            - Products priced between 20 and 50 euros → assign to **20–50 euros**.
            - Products priced over 50 euros → assign to **Over 50 euros**.
        !!! example "Sample Price-Based Categories"
            - Category: **Under 20 euros** → all products with a price `< 20`.
            - Category: **20–50 euros** → all products with a price between `20` and `50`.
            - Category: **Over 50 euros** → all products with a price `> 50`.
        - Repeat the process until every product you want to recommend is assigned to the correct price category.
    3. **Catalog Sync**: Run the [catalog sync](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/) from the success checklist to import new categories. After syncing, refresh the quiz page.
    4. **Configuring the Quiz to Filter Recommendations**: Return to the Revenue Hunt Quizzes app and open your quiz. Open the [Link Collections](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/) section. Find the `Upvotes` section and upvote and exclude the categories for each price range.
        !!! example "Configuring the Quiz to Filter Recommendations"
            - For the 'Under 20 euros' choice: Upvote the category for products under 20 euros. Exclude categories for products between 20 and 50 euros and over 50 euros.
            - For the '20 to 50 euros' choice: Upvote the category for products between 20 and 50 euros. Exclude categories for products under 20 euros and over 50 euros.
            - For the 'Over 50 euros' choice: Upvote the category for products over 50 euros. Exclude categories for products under 20 euros and between 20 and 50 euros.
            ![filter by collection example](/images/how_to_filter_by_price__legacy_filter_question_linkedcollections.png)
    4. **Testing the Price Filter Functionality**: Preview the quiz to test the filtering functionality. Select the option for products over 50 euros to verify that only those products are displayed. Repeat the test for the other price ranges to ensure accurate filtering. Confirm that the recommendations reflect the selected price range correctly.
        !!! tip "Troubleshooting"
            Check the [Response Analysis](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#response-analysis) tool in case of wrong recommendations.

        - Name the category (for example, **Under 20 euros**) and save it.
        - Edit your products and assign them to the corresponding price category:
            - Products priced under 20 euros → assign to **Under 20 euros**.
            - Products priced between 20 and 50 euros → assign to **20–50 euros**.
            - Products priced over 50 euros → assign to **Over 50 euros**.
        - Save the changes.
        !!! example "Sample Price-Based Categories"
            - Category: **Under 20 euros** → all products with a price `< 20`.
            - Category: **20–50 euros** → all products with a price between `20` and `50`.
            - Category: **Over 50 euros** → all products with a price `> 50`.
        - Repeat this process until all products you want to recommend through the quiz are assigned to the correct price category.
    3. **Catalog Sync**: Run the [catalog sync](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/) from the success checklist to import new categories. After syncing, refresh the quiz page.
    4. **Configuring the Quiz to Filter Recommendations**: Return to the Revenue Hunt Quizzes app and open your quiz. Open the [Link Collections](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/) section. Find the `Upvotes` section and upvote and exclude the categories for each price range.
        !!! example "Configuring the Quiz to Filter Recommendations"
            - For the 'Under 20 euros' choice: Upvote the category for products under 20 euros. Exclude categories for products between 20 and 50 euros and over 50 euros.
            - For the '20 to 50 euros' choice: Upvote the category for products between 20 and 50 euros. Exclude categories for products under 20 euros and over 50 euros.
            - For the 'Over 50 euros' choice: Upvote the category for products over 50 euros. Exclude categories for products under 20 euros and between 20 and 50 euros.
            ![filter by collection example](/images/how_to_filter_by_price__legacy_filter_question_linkedcollections.png)
    4. **Testing the Price Filter Functionality**: Preview the quiz to test the filtering functionality. Select the option for products over 50 euros to verify that only those products are displayed. Repeat the test for the other price ranges to ensure accurate filtering. Confirm that the recommendations reflect the selected price range correctly.
        !!! tip "Troubleshooting"
            Check the [Response Analysis](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#response-analysis) tool in case of wrong recommendations.

# Fixing Viewport Issue on Mobile

## Introduction

This guide addresses a common issue where the form on mobile devices is not fixed and moves from side to side, causing a poor user experience. This problem can be resolved by adjusting the meta viewport tag in the store's HTML.

## Problem Description

Users have reported that on mobile devices, the form page slightly zooms in when focusing on a text input, causing the page to move from left to right and resulting in a poor user experience. This issue needs to be addressed to ensure the form remains fixed on mobile devices.

## Solution

To fix this issue, the developer needs to modify the meta viewport tag in the store's HTML. The tag should include `maximum-scale=1.0` and `user-scalable=0` to prevent the page from moving.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. Locate the meta viewport tag in the HTML of your store. It might look like this:

   ```html
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0">
   ```

2. Modify the tag to include `maximum-scale=1.0` and `user-scalable=0`:

   ```html
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0">
   ```

3. If the meta viewport tag is missing, add the modified tag to the `<head>` section of your HTML.

![Fix viewport issue mobile](/images/fix_viewport_issue_mobile.png)

## Testing

After making these changes, test the form on a mobile device to ensure it remains fixed and does not move from side to side.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the changes are applied to the correct HTML file in your store.
- If you encounter any issues, consider reaching out to your web developer for assistance.

## Platform-Specific Instructions

--- WooCommerce Specific Content ---

1. Log in to your WordPress admin panel.
    2. Go to **Appearance** > **Theme Editor**.
    3. In the **Theme Files** section, find and open the `header.php` file of your active theme.
    4. Locate the `<head>` section in this file to modify the meta viewport tag.

# How to Show or Hide Content Based on Quiz Answers

In this article, you’ll discover how to use `IF-THEN` conditional logic to hide or show certain questions or sections based on customer answers to quiz questions. This includes conditionally hiding certain questions or statements within your quiz using [Jump Logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/) or [Skip Logic](/how-to-guides/use-skip-logic/) and showing or hiding blocks/sections on the Results page with [Display Logic](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/).

Using a skincare routine quiz as an example, we'll show how custom text and result can be displayed based on the customer’s skin type.

## Jump Logic: How to Show Custom Text in the Quiz
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HfYhbWB21Qg?si=gdRcqMWV35IOV0QA" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    ![how to hide content with logic jump logic](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_jump_logic.png)
    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add a `Multiple choice question` asking the customer about their skin type: Dry, Normal, Oily, or Combination-type skin. 
        !!! tip
            Use the description box in `Question Settings -> Show Description` to help customers determine their skin type.
    2. **Create Statement Questions**: Add multiple `Statement` slides describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:
        !!! example
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness – we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that’s deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn’t experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin’s natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
    3. **Add Jump Logic**: If we don’t add jump logic to the quiz, our statement questions will just appear one after the other, regardless of the choice we made. To add jump logic, you should go back to the skin type question and select [conditional logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/). Set up `IF-THEN` statements with `OR` logic to direct the customer to the correct text based on their skin type. 
        ![how to hide content with logic jump logic statement](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_jump_logic_statement.png)
    4. **Add "Always Jump to..." Logic**: Once all the statements are linked with logic to the skin type question, you should point each statement to the next question in the quiz. This is done by going to the [jump logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/) tab and scrolling toward the `Always jump to...` section. Point each statement to the next question.
    4. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.

        .no-variants-dropdown {
        display: none;
        }
        .lq-variants-dropdown {
        display: none;
        }
        ```
    4. Remember to publish the changes with the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.

# How to Track Quiz Performance with Google Analytics

--- WooCommerce Specific Content ---

To track quiz performance with Google Analytics in WooCommerce, you'll need to implement custom JavaScript tracking. This allows you to monitor specific quiz events and user interactions. 
    This article explains how to track quiz events and performance in Google Analytics. 
    !!! warning "GA4 Event Tracking Reliability"
        Since Google transitioned from **Universal Analytics** to **GA4**, event tracking reliability has significantly decreased.  
        The implementation code may be correct and events may fire as expected, but GA4 can still fail to read, process, or report them accurately.  
        If this occurs, we recommend **contacting Google Support**, as the issue is likely on their end.

        If this occurs, we recommend **contacting Google Support**, as the issue is likely on their end.
## Connect Quiz to Google Analytics
    !!! note
        Google Analytics GA4 tracking works best if you embed your quiz on a new page in your online store. Follow the instuctions in [this article](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-inline/#embedding-an-inline-quiz-on-a-new-page) to set this up.
    To track quiz events and performance in Google Analytics, you'll need to implement custom JavaScript tracking to your website, preferably the page where the quiz is embeded.
    To implement custom event tracking for your quiz, follow these steps:
    1. **Understand the Callback Function**: Visit the [FAQ page](/how-to-guides/use-callback-function/) to learn how our callback function works and how it can be used for tracking custom events.
    2. **Embed the Custom Script**: Add the following script to your store's theme where the quiz is featured (preferably sitewide in your theme's main template file):
        ```html
        <script>
        function prqQuizCallback(quizResponse){
            gtag('event', 'your_event_name', {
            'event_category': 'quiz',
            'event_label': 'specific_label',
            'value': quizResponse.someValue
            });
        }
        </script>
        ``` 
    3. **Customize Event Tracking**: Modify the script with appropriate event names, labels, and values to track specific user actions. For example:
        ```html
        <script>
        function prqQuizCallback(quizResponse){
            // Track quiz start
            if(quizResponse.type === 'quiz_started') {
                gtag('event', 'quiz_start', {
                    'event_category': 'quiz',
                    'event_label': quizResponse.quizName
                });
            }
            // Track question answers
            if(quizResponse.type === 'question_answered') {
                gtag('event', 'question_answer', {
                    'event_category': 'quiz',
                    'event_label': quizResponse.questionTitle,
                    'value': quizResponse.answer
                });
            }
            // Track quiz completion
            if(quizResponse.type === 'quiz_completed') {
                gtag('event', 'quiz_complete', {
                    'event_category': 'quiz',
                    'event_label': quizResponse.quizName
                });
            }
        }
        </script>
        ```
    4. **Monitor and Adjust**: Once implemented, regularly check your Google Analytics dashboard to ensure events are being tracked correctly. Adjust the tracking code as needed based on your specific requirements.

                });
            }
            // Track question answers
            if(quizResponse.type === 'question_answered') {
                gtag('event', 'question_answer', {
                    'event_category': 'quiz',
                    'event_label': quizResponse.questionTitle,
                    'value': quizResponse.answer
                });
            }
            // Track quiz completion
            if(quizResponse.type === 'quiz_completed') {
                gtag('event', 'quiz_complete', {
                    'event_category': 'quiz',
                    'event_label': quizResponse.quizName

                    'event_category': 'quiz',
                    'event_label': quizResponse.quizName
                });
            }
        }
        </script>
        ```
    4. **Monitor and Adjust**: Once implemented, regularly check your Google Analytics dashboard to ensure events are being tracked correctly. Adjust the tracking code as needed based on your specific requirements.

## Use GA4 Explorations
    Google Analytics 4 (GA4) offers **Explorations**, a powerful tool for digging deeper into your quiz data. Standard reports show you high-level trends, but Explorations let you ask more specific questions about how customers interact with your quiz and how it impacts revenue.
    With Explorations, you can:
    - **Compare quiz users vs. all users**. See how much revenue is generated by customers who start a quiz compared to those who don’t.
    - **Break down results by quiz**. If you run multiple quizzes, use Explorations to see which quiz names bring in the most purchases and revenue.
    - **Build funnels**. Visualize the full journey from *quiz\_started* → *results\_page\_viewed* → *product\_added\_to\_cart* → *purchase*, and spot where users drop off.
    - **Analyze user paths**. Discover what customers do after completing your quiz—do they view recommended products, add to cart, or head straight to checkout?
    - **Create segments and audiences**. Build an audience of “Quiz Users” for ongoing analysis or remarketing in Google Ads.
    Refer to the Google Analytics [documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7579450?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article) for more information on how to use GA4 Explorations.

## Tracking Engagement with Meta Events Manager
With the Pixel activated, the Meta **Events Manager dashboard** becomes a window into how users interact with your quiz. This data is vital for crafting [Custom Audiences](https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/lessons/custom-audience-tips-with-facebook-pixel) and [Lookalike Audiences](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/164749007013531?id=401668390442328) to refine your marketing strategies.
![how to integrate fb pixel events](/images/how_to_fb_pixel_events.png)
### Tracked Interactions
The Pixel will fire a `viewContent` event for the following user actions:
- Initiating a quiz
- Viewing a question
- Selecting an answer
- Reaching the results page
- Browsing a product
Each `viewContent` event is distinguished by a specific "category" tag, allowing for detailed tracking.
### Tracked Events
Besides the `viewContent` events, the Pixel will also track when a user:
- Adds a product to their cart
- Heads to the cart or checkout
- Answers an email question
- Answers a phone question
Here’s a list of all the tracked events:
| **Trigger** | **fbq_action** | **fbq_event** | **fbq_params** |
|---------------------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| User starts a quiz | `track` | `ViewContent` | `{ content_name: quiz_name, content_category: 'quiz' }` |
| User views a question | `track` | `ViewContent` | `{ content_name: question_title, content_category: 'question' }` |
| User clicks on a choice | `track` | `ViewContent` | `{ content_name: choice_text, content_category: 'choice' }` |
| User submits email | `trackCustom` | `EmailLead` | `{ content_name: quiz_name, content_category: 'lead' }` |
| User submits phone | `trackCustom` | `PhoneLead` | `{ content_name: quiz_name, content_category: 'lead' }` |
| User gets to results page | `track` | `ViewContent` | `{ content_name: results_page_title, content_category: 'results' }` |
| User gets to results page | `track` | `Lead` | `{}` |
| A certain product is recommended in the results page | `track` | `ViewContent` | `{ content_name: product_name, content_type: 'recommendation', content_ids: [sku_or_variant_id], value: product_price, currency: quiz_currency }` |
| Customer adds a product to cart | `track` | `AddToCart` | `{ content_name: product_name, content_type: 'recommendation', content_ids: [sku_or_variant_id], value: product_price, currency: quiz_currency }` |
| Customer proceeds to checkout | `track` | `InitiateCheckout` | `{ num_items: num_products_in_cart, currency: quiz_currency, value: value_of_products_in_cart }` |
| Customer retakes the quiz | `trackCustom` | `RetakeQuiz` | `{ content_name: quiz_name, content_category: 'quiz' }` |
## Review Custom Events

This section outlines the process for managing custom events in Metapixel after connecting it to your quiz application. It details the steps to review, acknowledge, and confirm the use of custom events for advertising features.
1. After connecting Metapixel to your quiz, new custom events will start appearing in your app.
    Standard events include: 
    - `View Content`
    - `Page View`
    - `Lead`
    Custom events include: 
    - `Retake Quiz Action`
    - `Email Lead Action`
    These custom events by default can't be used with ads features but you can enable them to be used with ads features by reviewing them.
2. In your Metapixel data sources, you will see a notification `Custom events can't be used with ads features.` regarding custom events.
    ![how to integrate fb pixel review custom events](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_integrate_meta_pixel_reviewcustomevents.png)
3. To remove this notification, you must review the custom events. Click on `Review` to proceed with the acknowledgment process.
    ![how to integrate fb pixel review custom events 2](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_integrate_meta_pixel_reviewcustomevents2.png)
    - By acknowledging, you agree to review the custom events to ensure compliance with terms and conditions. Click 'Acknowledge' and select the actions for the custom events.
        ![how to integrate fb pixel review custom events 3](https://loom.com/i/6f49a0bcff394c7f85b35addc0cb4294?workflows_screenshot=true)
    - You can choose to enable both custom events: Retake Quiz and Email Lead.
    - After selecting the desired custom events, click 'Next' to confirm their collection.
    - Confirming allows the custom events to be used with ad features, including custom and lookalike audiences.
    - Click 'Confirm' to finalize your acceptance and review of the custom events.
        ![how to integrate fb pixel review custom events 3](https://loom.com/i/89174c089c514d7abc80f0e506581bbc?workflows_screenshot=true)
4. Refresh your Metapixel dashboard to ensure the notification is gone.
5. Your data should now flow correctly, allowing you to use the custom events in your ads and audiences.
## Adding a Custom Pixel
    For an alternative approach to tracking user interactions, consider implementing custom JavaScript to measure specific events on your site. By incorporating our [callback function](/how-to-guides/use-callback-function/), you have the capability to manually trigger or log events based on user actions.
    To deploy this method, you can insert a script within the theme of your store's page, especially where a quiz is featured. Follow these steps:
    1. **Deactivate Meta Pixel**: If you have previously connected a pixel through the [Connect](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab, you'll have to deactivate it and publish the changes.
    2. **Understand the Callback Function**: Visit the [FAQ page](/how-to-guides/use-callback-function/) on custom integrations to learn how our callback function operates and how it can be utilized for tracking custom events.
    3. **Embed the Custom Script**: Insert the following script into the theme of your store’s page where the quiz or the event you want to track is located (load it sitewide and put it into the theme.liquid):
        ```html
        <script>
        function prqQuizCallback(quizResponse){
            window.fbq(action, event, params);
        }
        </script>
        ```
    4. **Customize Your Event Tracking**: In the script, replace the values with the appropriate event name, action, and params that you wish to track. This customization allows you to monitor specific user actions on your website.
    5. **Monitor and Adjust**: After the script is active and events are being tracked, regularly monitor the data to ensure everything is working as intended. Be prepared to make adjustments to the script or event definitions as needed.

# How to Fix Product Images Not Showing

This guide explains how to fix product images not showing in your quiz.

--- WooCommerce Specific Content ---

Our quiz is served through an iFrame on your website but it’s hosted on our server. Your developer will have to disable hotlinking protection on your website for the product images (which are pulled from your store) to appear on the results page.
    Hotlinking means displaying an image on a website by linking to the website hosting the image:
    [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotlinking](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotlinking)
    **Enable hotlinking in WordPress**
    Hotlinking in WordPress is usually enabled by default. WordPress allows you to use direct image URLs in your content, which can be hotlinked by other websites.
    If you want to allow our app to hotlink your images, you can whitelist our server `admin.revenuehunt.com` and our server’s IP address `3.14.55.225`.
    [This article](https://serverguy.com/disable-image-hotlinking-in-wordpress/) can guide you on how to enable hotlinking on your WordPress site by disabling hotlinking protection.

# How to Only Recommend Products with X Votes or More

It is possible to limit the number of recommended products on the results page by only showing products that received X votes or more (a certain minimum number of votes). This allows you to filter the quiz recommendations and only show the real winners. 

To activate this setting in your quiz follow the instructions below.

--- WooCommerce Specific Content ---

1. Make sure that you have a **Product Block** or a **Product Slot Block** that recommends products on your [results page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/). 
    2. Make sure you understand how our [recommendations algorithm](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/) works.
        ??? question "How do I get the right recommendations?"
            Our product recommendation algorithm works like a voting system:
            - Products are linked to each choice
            - When a customer picks a choice, all linked products receive one vote
            - After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted products sorted by the number of votes
            - If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty
            - If there's a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the order of products.
    2. To activate the `Minimum nuber of votes` setting navigate to the [Results Page settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/).
    2. Open the [Advanced Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#advanced-settings).
    3. Scroll down to find the `Minimum number of votes` setting and activate it by clicking the toggle.
        ![how to only recommend product with min votes results page settings](/images/how_to_only_recommend_product_with_min_votes_results_page_settings.png)
    4. Once this option is active, the **Products Block** (or a **Slots Block**) on your results page will show extra setting in the [Block Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings). 
    5. Open the [Product/Slot Block settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) and find the `Min. Number of Votes`. 
    6. Click on a dropdown and select a number. You can change the number of minumun votes to the number that fits your quiz setup. 
        ![how_to_only_recommend_product_with_min_votes_block_settings.png](/images/how_to_only_recommend_product_with_min_votes_block_settings.png)
        !!! example
            For example, if you have 4 questions in your quiz and you select 4 as a min. number of votes, only products that receive **4 votes or more** (aka match the answers in all questions) will be shown. If a product receives 3 votes, it will not be shown. If a product receives 5 votes it will be shown.
    7. Update the preview/live quiz with these new settings by clicking `Publish` in the top-right corner.
    From now on, only products that receive this minimum number of votes will show up as a recommendation on the results page.
    !!! warning
        The Minimum number of votes setting is only available if you choose not to recommend products when results are empty in the [Results Page Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#advanced-settings) > Advanced > `Recommendation Settings`.

# How to Pass Parameters to Pre-fill Quiz Responses

--- WooCommerce Specific Content ---

With RevenueHunt app you have the possibility to pre-fill the responses to certain questions in your quiz. 
    - This comes in very handy when users are logged in to your store and don’t want to ask them for the information you already have about them (eg. their name and email).
    - Another use case is when you’re driving traffic to your quiz from a mailing list and, again, you don’t want to ask them for their contact details.
    This feature can be implemented in two ways:
    - either declaring JavaScript variables in your store’s source code (note: developer needed)
    - passing URL parameters on a link to your store.

    - passing URL parameters on a link to your store.
## Option 1: Declare window.prq_vars
    You can declare `window.prq_vars` inside a JavaScript `<script>` tag in your store’s source code:
    ```html
    <script>
    window.prq_vars = {};
    window.prq_vars.name = 'John Doe';
    window.prq_vars.email = 'john.doe@gmail.com';
    window.prq_vars.phone = '+15556219645';
    window.prq_vars.cdRDCc = 'xDAwDe;aSEfBq';
    // question ID - choices IDs separated by ;
    </script>
    ```
    ### Example
    **Use case**: You’ve embedded the quiz on all product pages and want to know from which product page the quiz was taken.
    **Solution**: You can pass parameters to the quiz (eg. product ID) and “store” them in a question as a pre-filled answer.
    1. You will first need to create a `Short Text` question to store the product ID. Check how to add this question [here](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-types).
    2. Copy that question ID from [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).
    3. Then in your main product page include the following script, so you can add some script like this to your product page:
    ```html
    <script>
    window.prq_vars = {}; 
    window.prq_vars.questionID = 'productID';
    </script>
    ```
    That question will be automatically skipped if parameters have been passed, but note that if you use the quiz outside your product page you will need to also pass some “empty” parameter to that questionID otherwise it will be shown in the quiz.
    This way you will pass the productID as a parameter to differentiate where the quiz was taken from.
    You can declare `window.prq_vars` inside a JavaScript `<script>` tag in your store’s source code:
    ```html
    <script>
    window.prq_vars = {};
    window.prq_vars.name = 'John Doe';
    window.prq_vars.email = 'john.doe@gmail.com';
    window.prq_vars.phone = '+15556219645';
    window.prq_vars.cdRDCc = 'xDAwDe;aSEfBq';
    // question ID - choices IDs separated by ;
    </script>
    ```

    This way you will pass the productID as a parameter to differentiate where the quiz was taken from.
## Option 2: Pass URL parameters
    URL parameters (also known as query strings) are a way to structure additional information for a given URL. Parameters are added to the end of a URL after a `?` symbol, and multiple parameters can be included when separated by the `&` symbol.
    In order to pre-fill certain quiz responses, you can pass the following URL parameters when linking to your store (eg. linking from a newsletter):
    ```html
    prq_name=John Doe
    prq_email=john.doe@gmail.com
    prq_phone=+15556219645
    prq_cdRDCc=xDAwDe;aSEfBq
    // question ID - choices IDs separated by ;
    ```
    In case of differences in the values declared in the `window.prq_vars` and the values passed via URL parameters, the URL parameters will prevail.
    ### Example
    Here’s a link to our demo store **without passing parameters**. You’ll see that you have to fill in all the questions, including the name and email. Click on the following link and take the quiz:
    [https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/pages/inline-quiz/](https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/pages/inline-quiz/)
    On the other hand, in this other link we are passing URL parameters:

    You’ll notice that if you take the quiz now, the “name” and “email” questions are pre-filled and skipped.

# How to Set Up Automatic Popups

This guide walks you through setting up automatic popups on your eCommerce store, including popups that appear based on time spent on a page, across all pages, on the homepage, with exit intent, and options for showing popups multiple times per session.

!!! info "What's an Automatic Popup?"
    It's a quiz popup that appears after X seconds. The popup is shown only once per session unless `Exit Intent` option is enabled in the popup settings. Automatic popups can significantly enhance user engagement by presenting timely content or interactive elements like quizzes. 

!!! warning

    Automatic popups can be very intrusive which is why, by default, they are shown only once per customer session.

!!! note "Before you start"

    Before you start ensure you have a quiz created with the RevenueHunt app, access to the theme editor and (optional) basic understanding of HTML for editing themes.

    *Note: Directly editing your Shopify or other eCommerce theme's source code can potentially disrupt your store's functionality. If unsure about some steps, consider hiring a developer.*

    6. **Set Popup Conditions**: Configure when and where the popup should appear on your site.
    7. **Publish and Test**: After configuring your popup, publish it. Then, visit your site to ensure the popup appears as expected and that the quiz functions properly within the popup.
    1. Add the following embed.js script before the `</head>` close tag in the header.

        <script src="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/embed.js" async></script>

    2. **Configure the Extension**: Once installed, navigate to the backend of your Magento store. Go to the extension settings via the admin panel. Here you can create a new popup and configure its settings.
    2. **Obtain Automatic Embed Code**: From the quiz builder, click `Share`, select `Automatic` mode, and `Show Instructions for Legacy Themes`.
    3. **Generate Popup Code**: Adjust settings like popup duration, width or height and click `Get code` to generate an HTML code.
    3. **Embed the Quiz**: In the popup configuration, insert the HTML or JavaScript code for your quiz. This could will be the code generated from your "Product Recommendation Quiz".
    4. **Set Display Rules**: Configure the extension to show the popup on all pages. You might also set additional conditions like display timing, animation effects, and user interaction triggers (e.g., exit intent, time on site).
    5. **Save and Test**: After setting up everything, save your changes and test the popup on your live site to ensure it works correctly across different pages and devices.
    **Using Script Manager**
    1. Add the following embed.js script before the `</head>` close tag in the header.
        ```html

        Without it, the quiz won't be loaded on your website.

    2. **Create a New Script**: Click on `Create a Script`. Fill in the details:
    - Name: Give your script a name, e.g., "Product Recommendation Quiz".
    - Location on Page: Choose Footer to ensure the script loads at the end of the page, which is typical for popups.
    - Select Pages where script will be added: Choose All Pages to ensure the popup appears throughout your site.
    3. **Obtain Automatic Embed Code**: From the quiz builder, click `Share`, select `Automatic` mode, and `Show Instructions for Legacy Themes`.
    4. **Generate Popup Code**: Adjust settings like popup duration, width or height and click `Get code` to generate an HTML code.

    **Modifying Theme Files**
    Alternatively, if you need more control or if the Script Manager does not meet your requirements, you can modify the theme files directly:
    1. Add the following embed.js script before the `</head>` close tag in the header.
        ```html
        <script src="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/embed.js" async></script>

### Popup Displays Behind Website Header
If the Quiz Popup displays behind your website header or the `X` closing button is not visible it's likely that your website's header has an unusually high z-index. This can be fixed either from the app settings or from your website's theme.
    If the Quiz Popup displays behind your website header or the `X` closing button is not visible, try these solutions:
    - **Decrease the Z-index of your website's header.** You may need to check your theme files or contact your theme developer to do this.
    - **Move the `X` closing sign lower.** You can move the `X` quiz closing sign lower on the popup with a bit of custom HTML/CSS code that can be added to your website's theme or an empty HTML block on the page where the quiz popup is shown. Here's a sample code:
        ```html
        <style>
        .rh-widget span {
        top: 150px !important;
        }
        </style>
        ```
    - **Publish the quiz inline with a page instead.** If you don't want to make changes you can publish the quiz inline on a new page in your store. This way the quiz will be a part of it and you can link to that quiz page from other parts of your website. Check the instructions [here](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-inline/#embedding-an-inline-quiz-on-a-new-page).

Check the instructions [here](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-inline/#embedding-an-inline-quiz-on-a-new-page).
    If the Quiz Popup displays behind your website header or the `X` closing button is not visible, try these solutions:
    - **Decrease the Z-index of your website's header.** You may need to check your theme files or contact your theme developer to do this.
    - **Move the `X` closing sign lower.** You can move the `X` quiz closing sign lower on the popup with a bit of custom HTML/CSS code that can be added to your website's theme. Here's a sample code:
        ```html
        <style>
        .rh-widget span {
        top: 150px !important;
        }
        </style>
        ```

# How to recommend products that match multiple criteria (matrix)

This article outlines a method for recommending skincare products based on multiple criteria using a product matrix to categorize recommendations. 

It describes a step-by-step process involving creating product collections, linking products, and using a voting system algorithm to prioritize product suggestions, catering to complex customer profiles and ensuring personalized recommendations.

## Simple product matrix

--- WooCommerce Specific Content ---

Let’s say that you run a skincare shop and want to recommend a product based on two criteria – the client’s age and skin type.
    This means that your product matrix looks something like this:
    | Age/Skin type   | Dry or Normal                                                                                                                                                 | Oily                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Step 1: Understand the algorithm
First of all, you should understand that the recommendations algorithm works like a [voting system](#voting-system). 
??? question "How do I get the right recommendations?"
    Our product recommendation algorithm works like a voting system:
    - Products are linked to each choice
    - When a customer picks a choice, all linked products receive one vote
    - After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted products sorted by the number of votes
    - If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty
    - If there's a draw in the number of votes, the order depends on your Catalogue mode setting. By default, ties are randomized. Enable 'Preserve collection order' in [Settings > Catalogue](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#catalogue-settings) to show products in the same order as your Shopify collections.
    If you want to make the results ultra-precise, you can also:
    - Limit the recommendations to only show products that received X votes or more in the [Results Page settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#advanced-settings).
    - Use [Exclusions](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/#understanding-inclusion-and-exclusion) to make sure that unwanted products are not shown (even if they were upvoted in another choice earlier).
### Step 2: Create collections/categories
To recommend the right product, in your eCommerce platform you should create four collections/categories and include in them the following products:
- Collection 1: Teens and 20's
| Age/Skin type  | Dry or Normal                                                                                       | Oily                                                                                                          |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Teens and 20’s | Redness-Relief Refreshing Cleansing Lotion;<br>Ultra Facial Toner;<br>Khadi Global Natural Hyaluronic Acid Serum;<br>Moisturizing Cream-Gel | Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Face Wash;<br>Balancing Force Oil Control Toner;<br>Resist Ultra-Light Super Antioxidant Concentrate Serum;<br>Oil-Free Moisture Lotion |

### Step 5: Create a Products block on the Results Page
    For the products to show on the Results Page, you need to add a `Products Block`. 
    1. **Go to the Results Page tab**: You can do that by navigating to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/).
    2. **Add a Product Block**:  Clicking the `+` to add a block type. Slect a `Product Block` from the dropdown list.
    3. **Limit the number of recommended products**: In this example, we should limit the amount of recommended products to 4 (based on the matrix). To limit the number of recommended products shown open the `Product Block settings` and select how many products should be recommended in this Product Block from the dropdown.

To limit the number of recommended products shown open the `Product Block settings` and select how many products should be recommended in this Product Block from the dropdown.
### Step 6: Preview the quiz and check results
Now that the quiz is built and product are linked to each choice, you can test the quiz. To test the quiz, you'll have to save the changes and preview it.
1. **Publish the changes**: Click [`Publish/Save`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) on the top-right menu. Don't worry, clicking `Publish/Save` will not automatically add the quiz to your website. It will simply save the changes and allow you to preview the quiz.
2. **Preview the quiz**: Click [`Preview`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) to test the quiz you've created in a new window. You can test the quiz as much as you like as long as you always open a new preview window. These test responses done as admin are automatically removed after 1 hour to not add to your usage quota.
3. **Check results** : Go through the quiz and check if the correct products are recommended. Let’s check this answering route:
    - What’s your age?
        - 30’s and above
    - How does your skin feel on an average day?
        - Oily
If the quiz is set up correctly, the following products should be recommended in accordance with the product matrix:
![how to recommend products matrix results1](/images/how_to_recommend_products_results1.png)
If you’re not getting the expected results, please check [this article](/how-to-guides/troubleshoot-product-results/) to learn how to troubleshoot the quiz results.
??? question "Why were these products recommended?"
    To understand the quiz results, we need to recall how the voting system works. Every product linked to a choice receives one vote when clicked on. In the end, the products with the most votes will be recommended first on the Results Page.
    - So in our example, if the user selects “30’s and above” in the first question, the following 8 products will receive 1 vote each:
        ![how to recommend products matrix table1](/images/how_to_recommend_products_table1.png)
    - Next, if the user selects “Oily”, the following 8 products will receive 1 vote each:
        ![how to recommend products matrix table2](/images/how_to_recommend_products_table2.png)
    - After the two questions, the following 4 products will already have 2 votes each, because they were part of both collections:
        ![how to recommend products matrix table2](/images/how_to_recommend_products_table3.png)
    These products recieved the most amount of votes (2) so they were recommended.
    ![how to recommend products matrix results1](/images/how_to_recommend_products_results1.png)
    When products receive the same amount of votes, the algorithm randomizes the order in which they are shown on the Results page. By default, ties are randomized. Enable 'Preserve collection order' in [Settings > Catalogue](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#catalogue-settings) to show products in the same order as your Shopify collections.
If you’d like to organize the products in a specific order, you can create `Product Slots` on the Results Page. Check [this article](/how-to-guides/recommend-skincare-routine-slots/) to learn how to do that.
## Complex product matrix
    If your product Matrix looks more like a list, there is another way to achieve your precise product recommendations.  Let’s look at the matrix below. 
    ![how to recommend products complex matrix](/images/how_to_recommend_products_complexmatrix.png)
    The outcome of the quiz depends on 3 factors: skin type, age, and skin concern. In each case, the products recommended differing.
    For this complex matrix, creating separate collections for each outcome is possible, but there’s also an alternative. What you can do instead is to pick one of the factors and create branching in the quiz with [Jump Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic). This will allow you to show the customer the same questions but link different products to each branch, therefore resulting in different outcomes.
    Here’s an example of a Conditional Logic tree for the Matrix above where Skin Type was chosen as a branchign factor:
    ![how to recommend products complex matrix logic tree](/images/how_to_recommend_products_complexmatrix_logictree.png)
    The Jump Logic for bnranching is applied to *Question 2*, the skin type question.
    ![how to recommend products complex matrix jump logic 1](/images/how_to_recommend_products_complexmatrix_jumplogic1.png)
    ![how to recommend products complex matrix jump logic 2](/images/how_to_recommend_products_complexmatrix_jumplogic2.png)
    And *Questions 4, 6, 8, and 10* to point the customer to the Results Page directly after completing the branch:
    ![how to recommend products complex matrix jump logic 3](/images/how_to_recommend_products_complexmatrix_jumplogic3.png)
    This setup allows you to link different products to the same questions leading to differnt results, while maintaining the same customer experince.
    !!! tip
        Check this guide [Set up fixed recommendations quiz](/how-to-guides/set-up-fixed-recommendations-quiz/) to learn how to set up a quiz with fixed recommendations and display logic for very precise product recommendations.
    !!! warning
        A lot of conditional logic can significantly slow down the loading times of the quiz builder app (it doesn’t affect the quiz as viewed by the customer though). 
        If you plan on building a quiz with a lot of conditional logic, **consider splitting the quiz into multiple smaller quizzes** instead. There’s no limit to how many quizzes can be published on your webiste. 
        In the example above, you can create 4 different quizzes for skin types (Dry, Oily, Combination, or Normal skin), or you can create a quiz for different age groups.

# How to Recommend Products Based on Number of User Choices

??? question "Do I need advanced technical skills to set this up?"

    While the process isn’t entirely plug-and-play, with the assistance of a developer, it’s manageable. If you’re not familiar with JavaScript or CSS, seeking developer help is advisable.

## How do I recommend products based on the number of user choices?

The recommendation process is based on how many choices the user selects out of the given set. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Create collections/categories**. Create distinct collections for each group of products you wish to recommend, e.g., “1/10 choices selected,” “2/10 choices selected,” etc.
2. **Add hidden choices**. In your final question, include a multiple-choice option that correlates with the aforementioned collections/categories. This ensures that each choice connects to its respective recommended collection/category. Make sure to hide these choices from the user with custom CSS code.
3. **Add custom JavaScript**. Using custom JavaScript, evaluate the choices selected throughout the quiz and write a piece of code that automatically selects one of the hidden choices in the last question. This will determine which product collection/category to recommend based on the number of choices the user made.

## How can I ensure that users don’t see the choices in the last question?

You can hide these technical choices in the last question using custom CSS code. A guide on how to customize the quiz design can be found [here](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/).

## Where do I input the custom JavaScript code?

[This article](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) explains how to add custom JavaScript code to quiz questions. For example:

![recommend-products-based-on-number-of-user-choices image1](/images/recommend-products-based-on-number-of-user-choices_image1.png)

The custom JavaScript code should be integrated into the final question to assess the user’s choices and click the right choices in order to recommend a product collection accordingly.

## How can I identify the selected choices from each slide or question with JavaScript?

To review the values or choice IDs selected for each slide/question, you can use the JavaScript console and search for the values:

![recommend-products-based-on-number-of-user-choices image2](/images/recommend-products-based-on-number-of-user-choices_image2.png)

This guide provides information on how to set up a custom solution that will recommend products based on the number of user choices.

# How to Recommend Products Based on Numerical Inputs

Recommending products based on numerical answers (like age or room size) can be tricky if you use open-ended input fields. This guide will show you how to structure these questions in your quiz to trigger tailored recommendations using finite answer choices.

--- WooCommerce Specific Content ---

## Why You Need a Structured Approach
    Open-ended numerical questions like [Number](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#number) or [Date](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#date) allow users to enter any value — but that flexibility comes with a cost: **you can't directly link recommendations to those answers**. To deliver accurate product suggestions, you'll need a structured approach.
    ![open-ended numerical question](/images/how_to_recommend_products_based_on_numerical_inputs_shopify_agequestion_number.png)
    Questions like "What's your age?", "What's your birth date?" or "How big is your room?" might seem useful, but since users can input any number, you can't associate specific product recommendations with those responses.

## Use Finite Choices Instead
    To make recommendations work, **use multiple choice or dropdown questions**. Instead of asking for a number, offer predefined numbers or ranges.
    !!! example "Example - Age Ranges"
        Change "What's your age?" from an input field to a dropdown with:
        - Under 20
        - 21–30
        - 31–40
        - Over 40
        This lets you assign relevant products to each range.
        ![use dropdown question to ask age ranges](/images/how_to_recommend_products_based_on_numerical_inputs_shopify_agequestion_dropdown.png)
    Once you switch to finite answers, you can:
    - [Upvote](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) specific products, variants or collections to each choice
    - Set up [Jump Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) or [Display logic](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#display-logic-display-section-logic) based on the user's choices
    This is how to make sure that the product recommendation logic works in your quiz.

## Finalize the Setup
    After generating options, you can:
    - Switch between question types (dropdown, multiple choice, etc.) via [Block Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings)
    - Tweak the answer labels in [Choice Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings)
    - Assign products to each choice via the [Choice Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings)
    - Set up [Jump Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) or [Display logic](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#display-logic-display-section-logic) based on the user's choices
    This helps users select a range easily while ensuring you offer relevant products.

## Custom Calculations
    RevenueHunt Quizzes currently doesn't have a feature that would allow custom result calculations based on numerical user input.
    If you're building a quiz that requires custom calculations based on a precise numerical user input, for example a BMI calculation or dosage calculation, your developer can use the [Custom JavaScript](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) feature to add custom logic to your quiz results page. This approach involves accessing the quiz answers via the `console.log()` on the results page, programing custom behaviors on the result page with JavaScript and printing an output onto an HTML element. 
    In our [JavaScript guide](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) we provide an example of adding a [BMI calculator](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/#example-2-insert-calculations) to your results page.

# How to Recommend Products

Our solution takes into account your customer's choices to offer highly personalized product recommendations. 

This guide explains how to recommend products with the RevenueHunt app, the underlying algorithm and proposes solutions for complex quizzes.

## Recommendations

--- WooCommerce Specific Content ---

RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz can show on the results page **simple products**, **variable products**, **grouped products**, **external/affiliate products** and **[WooCommerce subscription products](/how-to-guides/recommend-subscription-products/)**. 
    RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz **cannot recommend categories** of products, though it's possible to [only recommend products from a specific category/tag/attribute](/how-to-guides/recommend-skincare-routine-slots/).
    !!! warning
        Product Recommendation Quiz for WooCommerce can sync only one type of variants of variable products. For example, if a variable product has two types of variants, the first one being size, the second being color, the app will be able to only sync the size variant of your products.
    RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz can show on the results page **product variants** and **main products**. 
    RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz **cannot recommend categories** of products, though it's possible to [only recommend products from a specific category](/how-to-guides/recommend-skincare-routine-slots/).

    RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz **cannot recommend collections** of products, though it's possible to [only recommend products from a specific collection](/how-to-guides/recommend-skincare-routine-slots/).
## Recommending the Right Products
    Follow these steps to set up product recommendations in your Product Recommendation Quiz:
    1. **Link Products to Choices**: Navigate to the [Link Products/Collections/Upvote](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) tab within your quiz setup. For each choice, link/upvote relevant products. 
        - You can link./upvote product variants, collections, tags, variant collections, vendor collections or all variants of the same product at once.
    2. **Edit the Results Page**: In the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) tab you can edit the content of your results screen. You can add a heading, content block, image block, HTML block, Product Block or a Product Slot block. 
        !!! tip
            Check [How to Edit the Results Page](/how-to-guides/edit-results-page/) for more information.
    3. **Add a Product Block**: Products can be displayed on the Results Page as a list via the `Product Block` or divided into slots via the `Product Slot Block`. For beginners, it's recommended to use a `Product Block` to show the recommendations.
        - **Product Block** displays the products sorted by the number of votes - the most voted products are shown first, and the least voted last. In [Product Block settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) you can **choose how many products you want to show** at the end of the quiz.
            ![how to recommend products product block](/images/how_to_recommend_products_product_block.png){width="500"}
        - **Product Slot Blocks** allow you to display the products in clear steps, for example as a skincare routine. Each Product Slot will recommend the most-voted product from a collection that's linked to it. *Check [How to Recommend a Skincare Routine with Slots](/how-to-guides/recommend-skincare-routine-slots/) for step-by-step instructions on how to set up Slot Blocks.* 
            ![how to recommend products slots block](/images/how_to_recommend_products_slots_block.png)
    4. **Test the Results**: After your products are linked and the results page is set up, you can test your quiz.
        - Click [`Publish/Save`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) on the top-right menu to update the preview/live quiz. 
        - Then, click [`Preview`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) to test the quiz you've created in a new window. 
            !!! note
                You can test the quiz as much as you like as long as you always open a new preview window. These test responses done as admin are automatically removed after 1 hour to not add to your usage quota.
    5. **Troubleshoot the Results**: Use the quiz's [built-in search tool](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) in the `Responses` section to understand why specific products were recommended or missing from the recommendations. 
        !!! tip
            Check [How to Troubleshoot Quiz Results](/how-to-guides/troubleshoot-product-results/) for detailed instructions on how to use this tool.
    6. **Refine the Results**: If you want to make the results ultra-precise, you can also:
        - **Limit the recommendations**: You can choose to limit the recommendations to only show products that received X votes or more in the [Results Page settings](/how-to-guides/only-recommend-products-with-minimum-votes/).
        - **Use Exclusions**: You can use [Exclusions](#exclusion) to make sure that unwanted products are not shown (even if they were upvoted in another choice earlier).
    By linking product variants and collections to quiz choices, and understanding the inclusion/exclusion logic, you can use our algorithm to offer precise product recommendations.

## Specific Setup Guides
### [Recommend Products Based on Numerical Inputs](/how-to-guides/recommend-products-based-on-numerical-inputs/)
With RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz, it is not possible to recommend products based on open-ended numerical questions like Number or Date. Instead, it's recommended to set up finite choices to be able to use the user responses to set up precise recommendations.
[This guide](/how-to-guides/recommend-products-based-on-numerical-inputs/) is designed to help merchants effectively use dropdown and multiple-choice questions to set up precise numerical recommendations.
[:fontawesome-solid-arrow-right: learn more](/how-to-guides/recommend-products-based-on-numerical-inputs/)
### Recommend products that match multiple criteria (matrix)
[This article](/how-to-guides/recommend-product-matrix/) outlines a method for recommending skincare products based on multiple criteria using a product matrix to categorize recommendations. 
| Age/Skin type   | Dry or Normal                                                                                                                                                 | Oily                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Teens and 20's  | Redness-Relief Refreshing Cleansing Lotion;<br>Ultra Facial Toner;<br>Khadi Global Natural Hyaluronic Acid Serum;<br>Moisturizing Cream-Gel                   | Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Face Wash;<br>Balancing Force Oil Control Toner;<br>Resist Ultra-Light Super Antioxidant Concentrate Serum;<br>Oil-Free Moisture Lotion     |
| 30's and above  | All Natural Face Cleanser;<br>Fresh Rose Deep Hydration Toner;<br>Khadi Global Natural Hyaluronic Acid Serum;<br>Organix Facial Moisturizer                     | FIRST AID BEAUTY FACE CLEANSER;<br>Balancing Force Oil Control Toner;<br>The Ordinary "Buffet" + Copper Peptides 1%;<br>Oil-Free Moisture-Combination Skin           |
It describes a step-by-step process involving creating product collections, building and linking quizzes to these collections, and utilizing a voting system algorithm to prioritize product suggestions, catering to complex customer profiles and ensuring personalized recommendations.
[:fontawesome-solid-arrow-right: learn more](/how-to-guides/recommend-product-matrix/)
### [Only Recommend Products with X Votes or More](/how-to-guides/only-recommend-products-with-minimum-votes/)
It is possible to limit the number of recommended products on the results page by only showing products that received X votes or more (a certain minimum number of votes). This allows you to filter the quiz recommendations and only show the real winners.
[:fontawesome-solid-arrow-right: learn more](/how-to-guides/only-recommend-products-with-minimum-votes/)
### Recommend Subscription Products
    If you're using a WooCommerce Subscriptions check [this guide](/how-to-guides/recommend-subscription-products/#woocommerce-subscriptions/) to learn how to recommend subscription products directly from the quiz.

[This guide](/how-to-guides/set-up-fixed-recommendations-quiz/#always-the-same-recommendations) provides a clear, step-by-step process to making sure that specific products are always visible on the Results Page of your quiz, regardless of the customer's choices.

### Show Results Explanation
    While our product recommendation algorithm works to recommend specific products, it will not automatically display an explanation of **why** a certain product was recommended. It also won't automatically display custom text depending on the recommended product. That's why it's hard to build a "personality-type" quiz with our legacy solution.
    If you're using a legacy version of the RevenueHunt app for Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, BigCommerce or Headless eCommerce (Standalone) check this guide to learn about possible workarounds: [How to Show Results Explanation](/how-to-guides/show-results-explanation/).

    While our product recommendation algorithm works to recommend specific products, it will not automatically display an explanation of **why** a certain product was recommended. It also won't automatically display custom text depending on the recommended product. That's why it's hard to build a "personality-type" quiz with our legacy solution.

# How to Recommend a Skincare Routine with Slots

With RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz, it is possible to group products into slots and recommend a product for each step in a beauty routine.

This guide is designed to help merchants effectively use [Product Slot Blocks](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#block-types) on the results page to organize product recommendations.

A personalized skincare routine recommendation quiz was chosen as an example to best demonstrate how to work with this feature. See an example of such a Skincare Quiz [here](https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/#quiz-rkHm6Y).
![how to recommend slots example](/images/how_to_recommend_slots_example.png)
## Step 1: Understand Recommendation Mechanism
Make sure that you're familiar with [how the recommendations work](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/) in RevenueHunt app.
??? question "How do I get the right recommendations?"
    Our product recommendation algorithm works like a voting system:
    - Products are linked to each choice
    - When a customer picks a choice, all linked products receive one vote
    - After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted products sorted by the number of votes
    - If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty
    - If there's a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the order of products.
    If you want to make the results ultra-precise, you can also:
    - Limit the recommendations to only show products that received X votes or more in the [Results Page settings](/how-to-guides/only-recommend-products-with-minimum-votes/).
    - Use [Exclusions](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/#understanding-inclusion-and-exclusion) to make sure that unwanted products are not shown (even if they were upvoted in another choice earlier).
It's advised to familiarize yourself with this [voting system](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/#voting-system) before working with Product Slots.
## Step 2: Organize Products into Collections/Categories
    To group products into slots, you’ll need to create new categories in your WooCommerce store. These categories will be used to group your products on the results page.
    1. **Identify Product Categories**: Determine your skincare product categories (e.g., Cleansers, Toners, Serums, Moisturizers).
    2. **Create Categories**: For each category, [create a category in your WooCommerce store](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-product-taxonomies/#product-categories) with the right products. Each category should only contain products relevant to its category. For example, 
        - a *Cleansers* category should have all the cleansing products, 
        - a *Toners* category should have all the toning products, 
        - a *Serums* category should have all the serums, etc. 
        - You can have more than one category that includes some of the same products.
    3. **Catalog Sync**: Perform a [catlog sync](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/) after creating collections to update RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz with the latest product collections.
    To group products into slots, you’ll need to create new categories in your Magento store. These categories will be used to group your products on the results page.
    1. **Identify Product Categories**: Determine your skincare product categories (e.g., Cleansers, Toners, Serums, Moisturizers).
    2. **Create Categories**: For each category, [create a category in your Magento store](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/categories/categories) with the right products. Each category should only contain products relevant to its category. For example, 
        - a *Cleansers* category should have all the cleansing products, 
        - a *Toners* category should have all the toning products, 
        - a *Serums* category should have all the serums, etc. 
        - You can have more than one category that includes some of the same products.
    3. **Catalog Sync**: Perform a [catlog sync](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/) after creating collections to update RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz with the latest product collections.
    To group products into slots, you’ll need to create new categories in your BigCommerce store. These categories will be used to group your products on the results page.
    1. **Identify Product Categories**: Determine your skincare product categories (e.g., Cleansers, Toners, Serums, Moisturizers).
    2. **Create Categories**: For each category, [create a category in your BigCommerce store](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Product-Categories?language=en_US) with the right products. Each category should only contain products relevant to its category. For example, 
        - a *Cleansers* category should have all the cleansing products, 
        - a *Toners* category should have all the toning products, 
        - a *Serums* category should have all the serums, etc. 
        - You can have more than one category that includes some of the same products.
    3. **Catalog Sync**: Perform a [catlog sync](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/) after creating collections to update RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz with the latest product collections.
    To group products into slots, you’ll need to create new collections in your Standalone account's [Catalogue](/reference/dashboard/#success-checklist). These collections will be used to group your products on the results page.
    1. **Identify Product Categories**: Determine your skincare product categories (e.g., Cleansers, Toners, Serums, Moisturizers).
    2. **Create Collections**: For each category, create a collection in your Standalone account via the [Catalogue](/reference/dashboard/#success-checklist) tab or a Google Product Feed with the right products. Each collection should only contain products relevant to its category. For example, 
        - a *Cleansers* collection should have all the cleansing products, a *Toners* collection should have all the toning products, 
        - a *Serums* collection should have all the serums, etc. 
        - You can have more than one collection that includes some of the same products.
    3. **Catalog Sync**: Perform a [catlog sync](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/) after creating collections to update RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz with the latest product collections.
## Step 3: Build the Quiz
1. **Add new quiz**: Go to the app’s [dashboard](/reference/dashboard/) and click [`add new quiz`](/reference/dashboard/#new-quiz).
2. **Choose a template**: Choose a pre-defined template or start from scratch. *Tip: There’s are Basic and Advanced Skincare Quiz templates already available.*
3. **Name your quiz**: The name can be edited later.
4.  **Add slides**: After that, you'll be redirected to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/). Add questions to your quiz that will help the customer determine their skincare routine. To add a question, click the `+ Add question` button. Select a [question type](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-types) from the dropdown/menu.
## Step 4: Link Products to Choices

# How to Recommend Subscription Products

This guide explains how to integrate and recommend subscription products with RevenueHunt app.

Recommending subscription products via the RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz can simplify your e-commerce strategy by providing a steady revenue stream and fostering long-term customer relationships. 

However, not all subscription apps are supported yet with the RevenueHunt app. Currently, we support [ReCharge Subscriptions](https://apps.shopify.com/subscription-payments?surface_intra_position=1&surface_type=partners&surface_version=redesign) for Shopify and [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) for WooCommerce.

If you're using a subscription app that is not supported, you can still recommend subscription products to your users by sending them to a single-time payment product page from the quiz results using [this workaround](#other-subscriptions). This will allow your users to subscribe to the product from the product page.

![how to recommend subscription products sample product](/images/how_to_recommend_subscription_products_sample_product.png)


!!! warning

    RevenueHunt app currently integrates with [ReCharge Subscriptions](https://apps.shopify.com/subscription-payments?surface_intra_position=1&surface_type=partners&surface_version=redesign) for Shopify and [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) for WooCommerce. Subscription products are not yet supported in the Product Recommendation Quiz for BigCommerce or Magento. They will not show up on the Results page. However, there’s a workaround explained in the [Other subscriptions](#other-subscriptions) section of the article.

## ReCharge Subscriptions

## WooCommerce Subscriptions
    Products created with [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) are automatically synced with the app when you install it. You can find them under [Link Products](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) tab in the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/).
    !!! tip
        If you don’t see your WooCommerce subscription products on the list, try to launch a [catalog sync](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/) of the app.

## Other Subscriptions
    For other subscription apps, there's a workaround that allows you to still guide your customers towards subscription options via the Product Reocommendation Quiz. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to implement this workaround effectively:
    **Step 1: Link One-Time Payment Products to Quiz Choices**
    1. Identify your subscription products that you wish to promote through the quiz.
    2. **Create one-time payment options**: Create equivalent one-time payment products for each of your subscription items. These will serve as placeholders in the quiz.
    3. **Link one-time payment products to chocies**: In the [Link Products](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) section, link each of these one-time payment products to the relevant quiz choices. This ensures that when a customer selects an option that would traditionally lead to a subscription product, they are instead matched with the corresponding one-time payment product.
    **Step 2: Adjust Checkout Settings**
    1. **Open Results Page settings**: Navigate to the [Results Page settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) within your Product Recommendation Quiz Results Page.
    2. **Change Checkout Settings**: Change the [Checkout Settings](/how-to-guides/change-checkout-settings/) from “Add to cart” to “Link to product.” This adjustment ensures that instead of adding the product directly to their shopping cart, customers will be directed to the product page on your website.
    As a result, the buyers will go directly to the product page and can subscribe there.

!!! info
      Redirecting with Jump Logic does not transfer quiz data to this new redirection page. If you want to send quiz data to another URL use the [callback function](#redirecting-to-a-custom-results-page-via-callback-function).
## Redirecting to a Custom Results Page via Callback Function
You can use our [callback function](/how-to-guides/use-callback-function/) to redirect the customers to another (custom-built) Results Page. This allows for greater flexibility in handling quiz data and customizing the quiz results look.
    !!! warning
          To do this, you'll need basic knowledge of JavaScript and handling JSON data.
    1. **Set Up the Callback Function**: Implement the [callback function](/how-to-guides/use-callback-function/) on your website to capture quiz results in JSON format.
    2. **Store and Redirect**: Configure the function to store the results locally (e.g., in the browser's local storage or cookies) before redirecting the user to your custom Results Page.
    3. **Access the Results Page First**: The callback function is designed to trigger upon reaching the quiz's results page. Make sure that the results page is loaded even for a fraction of a second for the data to trasfer correctly. This sequence ensures that the callback captures the quiz response, saving it as JSON in your website's local storage/cookies, before any redirection occurs. 
    4. **Use the Data**: On your custom page, use the `console.log(quizResponse)` function to retrieve and use the quiz data as needed.
    For a more detailed guide on setting up the callback function, refer to [this resource](/how-to-guides/use-callback-function/).

## Understanding Saved Versions
    Version History does not track every minor edit. Instead, it captures a new version each time you publish changes to your quiz with the top-right `Publish` button. 
    - A new version is saved only when you click `Publish` on your quiz. This action updates the preview/live quiz and records a version in the history. 
    - The interface uses colored `tags` to indicate where changes were made, such as to `questions` or `settings`, making it easier to identify the nature of each version. 
    - For better organization and clarity, you have the option to `rename` any saved version. This can help you keep track of significant changes or versions you may want to revert to later.

# How to Send Quiz Leads to Your CRM

## Direct Integrations

### [:fontawesome-brands-shopify: Shopify Customers](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-shopify-customers/)

You can add new customers automatically to your Shopify Customers list every time someone completes the quiz. Once someone leaves their email in the quiz, their Shopify Customer profile will be updated with their name, email, phone number and [customer tags](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/#customer-tags).

[:fontawesome-solid-arrow-right: learn more](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-shopify-customers/)

### [:material-wifi: Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/)

All the contacts coming from the quiz will be added to your Klaviyo Profiles. From there you can segment your customers and build a targeter email flow to upsell them. With our Klaviyo integration you can also add quiz contacts automatically to a List. 

[:fontawesome-solid-arrow-right: learn more](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/)

### [:material-hubspot: HubSpot](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-hubspot/)

By automatically sending quiz results to your HubSpot account, you can segment your contacts based on their responses and engage them with personalized campaigns.

[:fontawesome-solid-arrow-right: learn more](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-hubspot/)

### [:fontawesome-brands-mailchimp: MailChimp](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-mailchimp/)

Automating the transfer of quiz data to your Mailchimp account streamlines the process of segmenting your audience and enables targeted follow-up campaigns based on [customer tags](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/#customer-tags). Mailchimp integration only supports email, name, and customer tags to be send from the quiz. For more complex emailing/data needs, including direct product recommendations, consider using a different service.

[:fontawesome-solid-arrow-right: learn more](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-mailchimp/)

### [:material-information-slab-circle: Omnisend](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-omnisend/)

Apart from giving your customers a personalized product recommendation, you can connect your quiz to your Omnisend account so that the quiz results are sent automatically to your mailing list. This way you can segment them based on their responses and follow up with targeted campaigns.

[:fontawesome-solid-arrow-right: learn more](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-omnisend/)

### [:material-asterisk: Zapier](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-zapier/)

Zapier is a platform that enables integration with thousands of apps, including popular CRMs. Automating the transfer of leads from your quizzes to Zapier not only saves time but also allows for more targeted follow-up campaigns.

[:fontawesome-solid-arrow-right: learn more](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-zapier/)

### [:material-greater-than-or-equal: ActiveCampaign](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-activecampaign/)

### [:material-webhook: Webhooks](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-webhooks/)

Integrating the quiz with webhooks allows you to automatically send all quiz data, including responses, recommended products, and participant information, to your specified endpoints.

[:fontawesome-solid-arrow-right: learn more](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-webhooks/)

## Indirect Integrations

If we don't currently integrate with your CRM service and you want to send data there automatically you could set up a redirection via one of our current integrations such as [Zapier](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-zapier/) or [Webhooks](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-webhooks/).

Alternatively, you can also [send result emails directly from the app](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/) or [download all responses as a CSV file](/how-to-guides/download-quiz-responses/) and upload them manually your thrid-party service.

            ??? info "How to send an email every time someone completes the quiz?"
                First, you need to set up a segment based on the `PERMALINK-{{quiz_id}}` property to filter quiz takers. Once the segment is created, you can build a flow that triggers when users are added to this segment, sends them their quiz results via email, and then **removes the `PERMALINK-{{quiz_id}}` property from their profile** to allow for re-entry if they retake the quiz.
                For example:
                ![how to send leads to klaviyo resend email with each quiz retake](/images/how_to_klaviyo_resend_email_with_each_quiz_retake.png)
        5. Save the changes and turn the action `LIVE`.
        This way, each time a quiz taker takes the quiz again, they will be re-added to the segment and will trigger the email flow again.
    ??? tip "Deactive App Emails"
        Remember to deactivate the [email Notifications](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/) from the Quiz Builder once the Klaviyo flow is set up.

??? tip "Tip: Segmented Campaigns Work Better"
    It is possible to add contacts to Klaviyo List but there may be a better way: instead of adding them to a general list you can create **dynamic segments** based on your customers’ responses to send them hyper-targeted campaigns. Highly segmented campaigns return more than 3X the revenue per recipient as unsegmented campaigns.
    With Klaviyo you can create segments to filter your leads and assign email flows to each segment. [Read more](#sending-follow-up-emails-via-klaviyo) about how to create and use segments on Klaviyo.
## Use Quiz Data In Klaviyo Email Templates
    If you need to modify our Klaviyo email template to match your brand’s style guide, you’ll need a developer because email templates in Klaviyo are built using HTML, CSS and the [Django templating](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/templates/builtins/) system.
    We send all the responses to the quiz and the recommended products along with the contact information to the customer’s Klaviyo profile. This information will appear in the customer’s profile as `custom properties`.
    ![how to send leads to klaviyo customer profile](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_klaviyo_customer_profile.png)
    If you need to add any additional information to the email template, your developer can do so by pulling the appropriate `custom properties` from the user profile.

### Example Email Templates
    In this example, we’re using our quiz ID `dbqHqN`, which you’ll need to replace for your quiz ID. Here is the code for reference:
    ??? example "Example: Basic Slots Template"
        ```html
        <h3>Hello {{ person|lookup:'Q-dbqHqN ZMiXjj: .Before we get started... what\'s your name?'|default:'' }}!</h3>
        <p>Here we are making sure the product exists:</p>
        {% if person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_image_url' %}
        <p>Cleanser</p>
        <p><img alt="This is the cleanser image" src="{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_image_url'|default:'' }}" /></p>
        <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_name'|default:'' }}</p>
        <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_price'|default:'' }}</p>
        <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_sku'|default:'' }}</p>
        <p><a href="{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_url'|default:'' }}">Buy now</a></p>
        {% endif %}
        {% if person|lookup:'T-dbqHqN: 40s' %}
        <p>You are in your forties</p>
        {% endif %}
        ```
    This example demonstrated that you can not only include custom properties that are passed from the quiz to your Klaviyo account, but you can also use `IF-ELSE` conditional statements to show/hide content based on the customer’s responses to the quiz.
    !!! note "Note: Counting Products"
        Note that when looping through the products, the **count starts in 0 (zero)**, so for example, if you were to display the name of 3 products in a slot you’d have to do it like this:
            ```html
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_0_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_1_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_2_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            ```

    !!! warning "Note: These templates won’t work as is"
        Bear in mind that these templates (unlike the one generated from the Connect > Klaviyo tab) won’t work as is. They were created for a sample quiz. Your developer will have to modify the `custom properties` to match the ones that are passed from the quiz to your Klaviyo account. The `quiz ID` is different, so are other property names.
### Pull Product Information Directly from Shopify
There’s a feature in Klaviyo that allows you to pull the product information directly from Shopify by providing the id. This way you don’t need to use the `description` or `image_url` that is provided by revenuehunt, but can pull it directly from Shopify by providing the origin_id of the product. More information about this function can be found [here](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004785571-Overview-of-the-Catalog-Lookup-Tag).

By following this article, you can set up your post-quiz email flow with Klaviyo.

### Hack: Send Quiz Answers to MailChimp
    To override Mailchimp's limitation on pushing detailed quiz data, you can use `customer tags` to represent customer responses.
    1. For each possible quiz answer, create a corresponding [customer tag](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/#customer-tags) within your quiz setup. This requires planning to ensure each tag accurately represents the quiz responses.
        ![how to send leads to mailchimp tags](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_mailchimp_tags.png)

## Set up Post-Quiz Email Flow with Mailchimp
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PoLkSjl628o?si=iiIQVsgUgd46BJbu" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    If you want to set up a post-quiz email flow with Mailchimp, you can follow the steps below:
    1. **Connect Your Quiz to MailChimp.** Follow the instructions in the [Send Quiz Leads to Mailchimp](#send-quiz-leads-to-mailchimp) section.
        !!! tip
            Remember to take a test quiz/preview the quiz leaving a sample email address in order to send first data to MailChimp and test the connection. You can use your real email with a +test1, +test2 to test different answering routes. For example, youremail+test1@email.com or youremail+test2@email.com.
    2. **Use Customer Tags for Segmentation.** Once your quiz is connected you should consider what data you want to send to MailChimp from the quiz. You can, for example:
        - [Create customer tags in your quiz](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/#customer-tags) to represent different quiz responses.
        - Link these tags to specific answers in your quiz.
        - Upon completion of the quiz by a participant, Mailchimp will receive all the tags that the customer picked based on their choices.
        - In MailChimp, you can use these tags to segment your audience and tailor your email campaigns.
        !!! warning
            Mailchimp API only supports email, name, and customer tags to be send from the quiz. To override Mailchimp’s limitation on pushing detailed quiz data, you can use customer tags to represent customer responses.
    3. **Design Email Campaigns.** Once the quiz answers are covered with customer tags, all the information you need about your customer will start flowing into MailChimp. That’s when you can set up your email campaigns. 
        - You can start by setting up Automations (automated email flows) to trigger based on specific tags or quiz completions.
        - Then, create different email templates in MailChimp that correspond to different quiz outcomes or automation flows.
        !!! example
            Imagine you run a skincare eCommerce store. Your quiz asks customers about their skin type and concerns. Based on their answers, you tag them as “Oily Skin,” “Dry Skin,” etc.
            In MailChimp, you create an email series targeting these tags. For instance:
            - Day 1: Introduction to products suitable for oily skin. Check example [here](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mailchimp-newsletter1.png).
            - Day 3: Customer testimonials and reviews for oily skin products. Check example [here](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mailchimp-newsletter-2.png).
            - Day 7: Special discount on recommended products for oily skin. Check example [here](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mailchimp-newsletter-3.png).
            ![example mailchimp flow](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-29-093944-768x610.png)
    4. **Test and Optimize.** After setting up your email campaigns, test them with a test email and optimize them based on the results.

    4. **Test and Optimize.** After setting up your email campaigns, test them with a test email and optimize them based on the results.

    If you want to set up a post-quiz email flow with Mailchimp, you can follow the steps below:
    1. **Connect Your Quiz to MailChimp.** Follow the instructions in the [Send Quiz Leads to Mailchimp](#send-quiz-leads-to-mailchimp) section.
        !!! tip
            Remember to take a test quiz/preview the quiz leaving a sample email address in order to send first data to MailChimp and test the connection. You can use your real email with a +test1, +test2 to test different answering routes. For example, youremail+test1@email.com or youremail+test2@email.com.
    2. **Use Customer Tags for Segmentation.** Once your quiz is connected you should consider what data you want to send to MailChimp from the quiz. You can, for example:
        - [Create customer tags in your quiz](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/#customer-tags) to represent different quiz responses.
        - Link these tags to specific answers in your quiz.
        - Upon completion of the quiz by a participant, Mailchimp will receive all the tags that the customer picked based on their choices.
        - In MailChimp, you can use these tags to segment your audience and tailor your email campaigns.
        !!! warning
            Mailchimp API only supports email, name, and customer tags to be send from the quiz. To override Mailchimp’s limitation on pushing detailed quiz data, you can use customer tags to represent customer responses.
    3. **Design Email Campaigns.** Once the quiz answers are covered with customer tags, all the information you need about your customer will start flowing into MailChimp. That’s when you can set up your email campaigns. 
        - You can start by setting up Automations (automated email flows) to trigger based on specific tags or quiz completions.
        - Then, create different email templates in MailChimp that correspond to different quiz outcomes or automation flows.
        !!! example
            Imagine you run a skincare eCommerce store. Your quiz asks customers about their skin type and concerns. Based on their answers, you tag them as “Oily Skin,” “Dry Skin,” etc.
            In MailChimp, you create an email series targeting these tags. For instance:
            - Day 1: Introduction to products suitable for oily skin. Check example [here](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mailchimp-newsletter1.png).
            - Day 3: Customer testimonials and reviews for oily skin products. Check example [here](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mailchimp-newsletter-2.png).
            - Day 7: Special discount on recommended products for oily skin. Check example [here](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mailchimp-newsletter-3.png).
            ![example mailchimp flow](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-29-093944-768x610.png)

## Send Follow-up Emails with Omnisend
    It’s possible to set up a post-quiz email campaign in Omnisend to send the product recommendations or other offers to the quiz participants. 
    Below you’ll find some basic instructions that you can follow to set up an email flow in Omnisend. It covers creating a segment for quiz takers, setting up an automation workflow, and customizing email content with quiz results.
    !!! warning
        Email templates and flows are not something that’s a one-click install. It should be built by someone with technical knowledge and experience in Omnisend.
        Once the quiz is connected to Omnisend (and the data is sent there), it’s out of our app’s scope, and any particular questions on how to set up the flows and how to build the email templates should be directed to Omnisend.
    1. **Connect Your Quiz to Omnisend**: Refer to the instructions provided [here](#link-quiz-to-omnisend) to ensure your quiz is correctly connected to Omnisend.
    2. **Create a Segment for Quiz Participants**: In Omnisend, [create a segment](https://support.omnisend.com/en/articles/1400415-creating-segments) specifically for users who have completed the quiz. This can be done by filtering for a `custom property` that only quiz participants will have, such as `permalink_quiz_id`.
        ![how to omnisend segment](/images/how_to_omnisend_create_segment.png)
        - Use the custom properties to create a segment for users who took the quiz. Select a property (e.g., `permalink_quiz_id`) and copy it.
        - Go to 'Audience' > 'Segments' and create a new segment from scratch.
        - Add a filter using the copied property.
        - Name the segment something recognizable, e.g., 'Skincare Quiz Basic Segment' and save it.
        - Omnisend will automatically add profiles with this property to the segment.
    3. **Set Up an Automated Workflow**: Develop an [automation workflow](https://support.omnisend.com/en/articles/3954813-omnisend-automation-workflow-settings) in Omnisend that triggers when someone is added to the newly created segment of quiz participants. This step involves configuring Omnisend to automatically start the email campaign sequence for users in this segment.
        ![how to omnisend flow](https://loom.com/i/2e3ebc719c764822935b79d68c67456b?workflows_screenshot=true)
        - Navigate to the 'Automation' section in OmniSend.
        - Explore existing workflows or create a new workflow from scratch.
        - Set a trigger for the workflow: select 'When someone enters the segment' and choose the segment you created, e.g., 'Skincare Quiz Basic Segment'.
        - Save the changes to initiate the workflow when users enter the segment.
    4. **Customize the Email Template**: Customizing the email template to include quiz results and product recommendations requires HTML, CSS, and [Django templating](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/templates/builtins/) knowledge. Use Omnisend’s existing email templates as a base and modify them to incorporate the quiz data as custom properties. Ensure the template aligns with your brand’s style guide.
        - Drag and drop an email action below the trigger in the workflow.

### Customer Tags in Omnisend
Note that while customer profiles are updated with new quiz takes—including answers and product recommendations—Omnisend does not automatically remove unselected tags from previous sessions. A `tags_quizID` property is used to track the latest customer tags, which can be utilized to create segmented audiences for targeted marketing efforts.
### Email Templates
    Here are some email templates that you can use as a reference:
    - [Basic Slots Template (4-Step Skincare Routine)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wy-_nb0nGyU0_NsWB6YZMiXbXiA2sMyrGu6ks7TqzjQ/edit?usp=sharing)
    - [Advanced Slots Template (Morning & Night Routine)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RIXL2zF0ErGbUX5IwCRXjnr8bNV3wXuZQuuy3NmbL_I/edit?usp=sharing)
    - [Products List Template (Coffee Recommendations)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/175YmJpZ_iTahGFip46MGb6fcn5cupNsCEuZFxMnFCAg/edit?usp=sharing)
    Bear in mind that the templates won’t work by just copy/pasting. These templates were created for our demo quiz. Your developer will have to modify the `custom properties` in these templates to match the ones that are passed from the quiz to your Omnisend account. The `quiz ID` is different, so are other property names. After the changes are made, your developer can insert the code as a `custom HTML block` on the Omnisend email template.

# How to Send Leads to Webhooks

Integrating thw quiz with webhooks allows you to automatically send all quiz data, including responses, recommended products, and participant information, to your specified endpoints. 

This guide will walk you through the steps to link your quiz to custom webhooks, enabling instant data integration for further processing or analysis.

Before you start, ensure you have:

- A RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz from which you want to send data.
- A valid webhook URL to receive the data. You can use a service like [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site) to generate a temporary endpoint if you want to test the feature.

## Link Quiz to Webhooks

--- WooCommerce Specific Content ---

To initiate the integration:
    1. Navigate to the [Connect](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) section of your quiz.
    2. Scroll down to the "Webhooks" option and click on `Connect` to expand the input field.
    3. In the newly opened line, paste your webhook URL. The system will automatically save the URL once entered.
    4. After adding the webhook URL, click on the three dots `…` next to the webhook entry and select `Test webhook` from the dropdown menu.
    5. A successful connection test will result in a message, the appearance of which may vary based on your webhook's configuration.
        ![how to webhook success](/images/how_to_webhook_success.png)
    6. If an error occurs during the test, perform the following checks:
        - Verify that your quiz has received responses by checking the `Metrics -> Responses` section. If no responses are present, generate test responses by selecting `Previewing` it.
        - Confirm the correctness of the webhook URL and its active status.
    7. **Configuring HTTP Headers (Optional)**: For enhanced security or specific data handling requirements, you can add HTTP headers to your webhook.
        1. After a successful connection test, select `+add new header` to open header fields.
        2. Enter the data for your HTTP headers, which will be sent along with the quiz data in a POST request.
    8. **Activating Your Webhook**: With testing and configuration complete, activate your webhook. Use the toggle button next to your webhook entry to activate it. This switch allows for easy deactivation should the need arise.
    Upon activation, all quiz data will be transmitted to your webhook URL via a POST request (including headers).

## Troubleshooting Broken JSON Responses in Webhooks
If you're experiencing issues where a webhook response contains broken or invalid JSON, here's a step-by-step guide to help you identify and resolve the problem.
**Common Scenario**: When using webhooks to send quiz data, the response may appear broken or improperly formatted. For example, you may see incomplete or misaligned JSON objects in your logs. This could result from an unexpected content type or header configuration.
**Steps to Resolve the Issue**
1. **Check the Content-Type Header:**
    - Inspect the content-type of the webhook payload. 
    - Log the headers to verify the content type being sent. If it is unexpected, this could cause the payload to be interpreted incorrectly.
    Example:
    ```bash
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    ```
2. **Verify the Header Configuration**:
    - Compare the headers in your app's webhook configuration with the expected content type in the documentation.
    - If the content type differs, it may need to be overridden manually in your webhook configuration.
    Example:
    ```json
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
    ```
3. **Override the Content-Type in the App Config**:
    - Update the webhook configuration to explicitly set the correct `Content-Type` header.
    - For example, change the content type to `application/json`.
4. **Test the Webhook Connection**:
    After updating the configuration, test the connection:
    - Disconnect the webhook.
    - Reconnect the webhook and test it.
    - Ensure the webhook is properly activated.
5. **Validate the JSON**:
    - Use a tool like [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/) to validate the JSON payload.
    - Paste the payload into the tool to ensure it conforms to proper JSON formatting.
6. **Publish Your Changes**:
    - Ensure you click the `Publish` button in the top-right corner after making updates to the webhook configuration. 
    - Missing this step may result in the changes not being applied.
7. **Retest the Integration**:
    - Complete a full end-to-end test of the quiz, submitting valid test data (e.g., email address, phone number, etc.).
    - Confirm that the webhook receives the corrected JSON payload.
---
By following this article, you can set up your data flow with Webhooks.

# How to Send Result Emails from Your Server Using SMTP

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for sending emails across the internet. By connecting your Product Recommendation Quiz created with Revenuehunt app to an SMTP server, emails are sent from your account instead of revenuehunt, enhancing brand consistency and trust.

!!! tip "Connect your SMTP server to your quiz if:"
    - You're sending result emails to quiz respondents.
    - You're sending emails to a specific email address with notifications about each new quiz completion.

    Connecting your SMTP server to your quiz will allow you to send emails from your own email servers instead of Revenuehunt email servers and is a recommended practice.

For Office 365 SMTP, whitelist IP `3.14.55.225` to allow email sending.
- **Whitelisting Steps**:
    - Sign into Office 365, select `Admin`, then `Exchange` under `Admin Centers`.
    - In `Protection`, choose `Connection Filter` and edit with the pencil icon.
    - Add IP `3.14.55.225` to the `IP Allow List` and enable the `Enable Safe List`.
### Google Workspace Users
To find credentials to fill in please check [this Google documentation](https://support.google.com/a/answer/176600?hl=en).
![how to set up smtp google](/images/how_to_smtp_googleworkspaceinstructions.png)
- **Enable 2-Step Verification** (2FA): Required for SMTP connections.
    - [Enable 2FA](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839)
- **Generate App Password** for SMTP:
    - Navigate to [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).
    - Select `Mail` and `Other`, generate a password for use in SMTP settings.
## Troubleshooting: Common SMTP Connection Issues
- **Test Credentails with Thrid Party Tool**: Utilize third-party tools like [GMass SMTP Test](https://www.gmass.co/smtp-test) for SMTP settings verification. If the credentials work there, they will also work in our app. Should you encounter issues, consult with your developer or SMTP service provider.
- **SMTP Settings Not Working**: Ensure correctness with third-party tools. If issues persist, verify with your SMTP provider.
- **Office 365 Email Blocking**: Contact support to whitelist IP `3.14.55.225` if emails are not sending.
- **Google Workspace SMTP Failure**: Check if 2FA is enabled and correct app password is used. SMTP port 587 or 465 should work; if not, retry or check Google's support for updates.

    1. **Add Your SMTP Credentials**: Go to [`App Settings > SMTP`](/reference/app-settings/#smtp) and provide your email SMTP credentials. Follow [these instruction](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails-from-custom-server/) to learn how to set this up.
        ![manual_appsettings_smtp](/images/manual_appsettings_smtp.png)
        !!! note
            SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. SMTP is a connection protocol that enables third-party apps (e.g. RevenueHunt) to send emails through your email server.
            When you connect the RevenueHunt app to your SMTP Server, the follow-up emails with the quiz results that are sent to your customers will be sent from your email account.
            <b>If you're unsure what credentials to use, check your email provider's documentation (look for "SMTP") or contact their customer support.</b>
    1. **Add Email Question**: Before you set up your result emails, you need to make sure that the quiz has an email question. To add an email question go to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/).
    2. **Activate Respondent Emails**: Go to [`Notifications > TO RESPONDENT`](/reference/quiz-builder/notifications/#to-respondent) and toggle the `Send email when someone completes the quiz` button to activate the emails.
        ![how to activate to respondent emails](/images/manual_quizbuilder_notifications_torespondent_active.png)
    3. **Edit REPLY-TO**: Choose what email the customers will be able to reply to once they recieve the results.
    4. **Email TO**: If you have more than one email question in your quiz, choose an answer to which email question should be used to send the result emails. If you have only one email question, it will be selected by default.
    5. **Email Subject**: Edit the title of the email that customers will receive. You can use `@` to [recall information](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) such as the customer name or the quiz name in the title field.
    5. **Edit Email Content**: Configure the email your customers will receive. You can choose between a **Basic (text)** email format or **Advanced (HTML)** email format. You can switch between the two by clicking `switch to advanced HTML message` or `switch to basic text message` in the `Email Text Message` field.
        - **Basic text** email template is easy to use. Type the text that you want the customer to see in the `Email Text Message` field. You can personalize the email subject and content. You can add dynamic elements with `@`. Use `@` / [Information Recalls](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) to recall quiz information in the email body. You can recall data such as customer name, email, phone number, quiz name, question responses, recommended products and more. Basic email template does not allow the display of images or color customization but offers maximum deliverability.
        ![how to send result emails basic tempalte](/images/manual_quizbuilder_notifications_torespondent_active_basic.png)
        - **Advanced HTML** email template requires the knowledge of HTML and [Handlebars helpers](https://github.com/helpers/handlebars-helpers) to be edited. Incorporate quiz response metadata like `{{first_name}}` to personalize emails. You can use Handlebars to loop through and display recommended products or customize content based on quiz outcomes. Note that HTML emails are not rendered the same in different email clients and that you should add styles inline, not as classes. You also can’t add JavaScript code since it won’t be executed by email clients. Read more about styling Advanced HTML Email temapltes [here](#advanced-html-email-templates).
        ![how to send result emails html template](/images/manual_quizbuilder_notifications_torespondent_active_html.png)
    6. **Publish the changes**: Remember to publish the changes with the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.

## Sending Result Emails with Your CRM
You can automate the process of sending quiz result emails using your own CRM platform. Connect your quiz to one of our [available integrations](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-crm/), and the quiz data will be transmitted to your CRM as soon as the customer completes the quiz and reaches the results page. This allows you to set up your own email sequences directly within your CRM. For guidance on connecting the quiz to our integrations, refer to the [documentation provided for each integration](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-crm/).
## Activate Email Notifications To Admin
You can receive an email notification every time someone completes the quiz or proceeds to checkout to your specified email address. This allows the quiz admin/responsible to stay up to date with quiz engagments. 
!!! warning
    We recently encountered issues with our previous email provider and switched to a new service. Unfortunately, some emails were affected by this change, and not all TO-SELF notifications have been going through as expected. 
    Starting on <b>November 29th, 2024</b>, we kindly ask you to [configure your SMTP settings](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails-from-custom-server/) to continue receiving notification emails through the app. Notification emails will now be sent from your email address ensuring deliverabilty.

## Editing Email Templates
    **Using Metadata**
    Each quiz response has metadata which can be used in your emails to personalize them. You can see the `metadata` from the quiz response on the right hand side of each notification:
    ![how to send result emails metadata](/images/how_to_send_result_emails_metadata.png)
    The metadata from a quiz response can include various details that are useful for personalizing email communications.
    For example:
    - **Show Customer Name**: If you wish to display the respondent’s name, you can use the `{{first_name}}` handlebar in your code.
        ```html
        <p>Hello {{first_name}},</p>
        ```
        It should render as:
        ```
        Hello Alex,
        ```
    - **Recommended Products in Metadata**: The most recommended products are listed within the metadata JSON under the `products` property.
    **Usign Handlebars**
    You can use Handlebars to add more functionality to your HTML email template.
    For more detailed guidance on using handlebars in your HTML email templates, refer to the following resources:
    - Handlebars Builtin Helpers: [Handlebars Built-in Helpers](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/builtin-helpers.html)
    - GitHub Handlebars Helpers: [Handlebars Helpers on GitHub](https://github.com/helpers/handlebars-helpers)
    The format for helpers in Notifications might slightly differ from those on GitHub. For instance, to truncate a product name to 7 characters, you should write:
    ```handlebars
    {{truncate product.name 7}}
    ```
    If you want to present specific metadata you should use a special property `{{#eq}} ... {{/eq}}`
    - To target all slot blocks:
    ```handlebars
    {{#eq block.type "SlotsBlock"}} ... {{/eq}}
    ```
    - To target a specific block, for example, a block with the ID `A4TeY9`:
    ```handlebars
    {{#eq block.id "A4TeY9"}} … {{/eq}}
    ```
    Specific use cases:
    - **List the Recommended Products**: If you want to loop through the most recommended products, you can do so like this:
        ```html
            {{#each products as | product |}}
        <div style="overflow:hidden; margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <img src="{{product.image_url}}" alt="{{product.name}}" width="48" height="48" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px;"/>
        <span style="height:48px;float:left">
        <a href="{{product.url}}" target="_blank">{{product.name}}</a>
        <br>{{product.price}} USD</span>
        </div>
        {{/each}}
        ```
    - **List recommended products with Slot Titles**: If you want to list the most recommended product with Slot titles, you can do so like this:
        ```html
        {{#each blocks as |block|}}
        {{#eq block.type "SlotsBlock"}}
        {{#each block.slots as |slot|}}
        <b>{{slot.title}}</b><br>
        {{#each products as |product|}}
        <div style="overflow:hidden; margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <img src="{{product.image_url}}" alt="{{product.name}}" width="48" height="48" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px;"/>
        <span style="height:48px;float:left">

        {{#each block.products as |product|}}
        <div style="overflow:hidden; margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <img src="{{product.image_url}}" alt="{{product.name}}" width="48" height="48" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px;"/>

        </div>
        {{/each}}
        {{/eq}}
        {{/each}}
        ```
    - **List recommended products separated by Slot Blocks**: If you want to recommend a Morning and Night slot routine separately you can use the following code. Make sure to change the block IDs (“A4TeY9” and “PPT2PG”) to the ones in your quiz.
        ```html
        <h3>Let’s start with your morning routine</h3>
        {{#each blocks as |block|}}
        {{#eq block.id "A4TeY9"}}
        {{#each block.slots as |slot|}}
        <b>{{slot.title}}</b><br>
        {{#each products as |product|}}
        <div style="overflow:hidden; margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <img src="{{product.image_url}}" alt="{{product.name}}" width="48" height="48" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px;"/>
        <span style="height:48px;float:left">
        <a href="{{product.url}}" target="_blank">{{product.name}}</a>
        <br>{{product.price}} USD</span>
        </div>
        {{/each}} 
        {{/each}}
        {{/eq}}
        {{/each}}
        <br>
        <h3>Finish the day with your night routine</h3>
        {{#each blocks as |block|}}
        {{#eq block.id "PPT2PG"}}
        {{#each block.slots as |slot|}}
        <b>{{slot.title}}</b><br>
        {{#each products as |product|}}
        <div style="overflow:hidden; margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <img src="{{product.image_url}}" alt="{{product.name}}" width="48" height="48" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px;"/>
        <span style="height:48px;float:left">
        <a href="{{product.url}}" target="_blank">{{product.name}}</a>
        <br>{{product.price}} USD</span>
        </div>
        {{/each}} 
        {{/each}}
        {{/eq}}
        {{/each}}
        ```
    **Using Metadata**
    Each quiz response has metadata which can be used in your emails to personalize them. You can see the `metadata` from the quiz response on the right hand side of each notification:
    ![how to send result emails metadata](/images/how_to_send_result_emails_metadata.png)
    The metadata from a quiz response can include various details that are useful for personalizing email communications.
    For example:
    - **Show Customer Name**: If you wish to display the respondent’s name, you can use the `{{first_name}}` handlebar in your code.
        ```html
        <p>Hello {{first_name}},</p>
        ```
        It should render as:
        ```
        Hello Alex,
        ```
    - **Recommended Products in Metadata**: The most recommended products are listed within the metadata JSON under the `products` property.
    **Usign Handlebars**
    You can use Handlebars to add more functionality to your HTML email template.
    For more detailed guidance on using handlebars in your HTML email templates, refer to the following resources:

    - GitHub Handlebars Helpers: [Handlebars Helpers on GitHub](https://github.com/helpers/handlebars-helpers)
    The format for helpers in Notifications might slightly differ from those on GitHub. For instance, to truncate a product name to 7 characters, you should write:
    ```handlebars
    {{truncate product.name 7}}
    ```
    If you want to present specific metadata you should use a special property `{{#eq}} ... {{/eq}}`
    - To target all slot blocks:
    ```handlebars
    {{#eq block.type "SlotsBlock"}} ... {{/eq}}
    ```
    - To target a specific block, for example, a block with the ID `A4TeY9`:
    ```handlebars
    {{#eq block.id "A4TeY9"}} … {{/eq}}
    ```
    Specific use cases:
    - **List the Recommended Products**: If you want to loop through the most recommended products, you can do so like this:
        ```html
            {{#each products as | product |}}
        <div style="overflow:hidden; margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <img src="{{product.image_url}}" alt="{{product.name}}" width="48" height="48" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px;"/>
        <span style="height:48px;float:left">
        <a href="{{product.url}}" target="_blank">{{product.name}}</a>
        <br>{{product.price}} USD</span>

With the RevenueHunt app it is possible to set up Multiple Results Pages. To add an extra Results Page to your quiz follow the instructions below.

!!! warning

    Adding multiple results pages increases complexity, may lead to unexpected product recommendations, and can impact quiz loading speed. **For maximum conversions and sales, we recommend using only one results page.**

    However, multiple results pages can be beneficial in certain scenarios:

    - Personalized discounts: Show different discounts (or no discount) based on customer preferences or responses.
    - Email collection strategies: Offer unique results based on whether the customer leaves their email address or not.
    - Simplifying conditional logic: If you have a long list of similar conditional blocks, using multiple results pages can make it easier to organize and manage logic by giving each page a clear name.
    - Special cases: Some businesses, like medical & supplements companies, might use separate results pages to inform customers when they are not eligible for certain products, e.g., "You're not qualified for X due to [specific reason]."

    Carefully consider your quiz goals before enabling this feature to ensure it aligns with your business objectives.

![docs/images/how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_displaylogic.png](/images/how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_displaylogic.png){width=500}
    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add a `Multiple choice question` asking the customer about their skin type: Dry, Normal, Oily, or Combination-type skin. 
        !!! tip
            Use the description box in `Question Settings -> Show Description` to help customers determine their skin type.
    2. **Add Content Blocks to Results Page**: Go to the Results Page and add a new `content block`. To add a content block click the `+` sign and select `Content Block` from the list. Add multiple content blocks describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:
        !!! example
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness – we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that's deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn't experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin's natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
        !!! tip    
            Make the heading stand out with [markdown language](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/). Use the`#` sign before a sentence can make it bold.

    4. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.
    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add a `Multiple choice question` asking the customer about their skin type: Dry, Normal, Oily, or Combination-type skin. 
        !!! tip
            Use the description box in `Question Settings -> Show Description` to help customers determine their skin type.
    2. **Add Content Blocks to Results Page**: Go to the Results Page and add a new `content block`. To add a content block click the `+` sign and select `Content Block` from the list. Add multiple content blocks describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:
        !!! example
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness – we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that's deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn't experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin's natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
        !!! tip    
            Make the heading stand out with [markdown language](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/). Use the`#` sign before a sentence can make it bold.

## Fixed Recommendations with Display Logic and Multiple Results Pages 
Set up multiple results pages with unique fixed product recommendations and texts and control visbility by adding branching with Jump Logic that leads to diferent results pages.	
!!! note
    The difference between this method and the previous one is that in this method you set up multiple results pages and control visbility by adding branching with Jump Logic that leads to diferent results pages while the previous method is a single results page with multiple content + product blocks controlled by Display Logic. 
    Overall, both methods are the same, the difference is only in where you add the conditonal logic (Display Logic vs Jump Logic).

# How to Set Up Funnel Quiz

A Funnel Quiz helps your customers find the best product by assigning "votes" to products as they answer questions. The quiz counts these votes and recommends the most relevant products at the end.

!!! info "Use this method for:"

    - Helping customers narrow down a large product catalog
    - Most quizzes, especially product finders
    - Your first product recommendation quiz
    - Quizzes without complex branching


## ✍🏻 Voting System

Our product recommendation algorithm works like a voting system:

- Product variants are linked to each choice.
- When a customer picks a choice, all linked products receive one vote.
- After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted product variants sorted by the number of votes.
- If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty.
- If there's a draw in the number of votes, the order depends on your Catalogue mode setting. By default, ties are randomized. Enable 'Preserve collection order' in [Settings > Catalogue](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#catalogue-settings) to show products in the same order as your Shopify collections.

**Understand Inclusion and Exclusion**

### Inclusion
Products or collections added in the `include/upvotes` field of the [Link Products/Collections/Upvote](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) tab are upvoted in the final recommendations.

--- WooCommerce Specific Content ---

![how to recommend products inclusion](/images/how_to_recommend_products_inclusion.png)
    How the votes work for each included linked item:
    - **Simple Products** - Individual products receive a vote when their linked choice is selected.
    - **Product variants**: Individual variants receive a vote when their linked choice is selected. Note that only product variants are directly linked to choices. However, on the results page, variants can be grouped under their parent products for a streamlined shopping experience.
    - **Product Bundles**: A bundle is treated as an individual product. Every bundle recieves one vote when their linked choice is selected.
    - **Affiliate Products** - Individual products receive a vote when their linked choice is selected. On the results page the customer is redirected to the affiliate link (not the store link).
    - **Categories**: Every product within a linked category receives a vote when their linked choice is selected.
    - **Tags**: Every product within a linked tag receives a vote when their linked choice is selected.
    - **All variants of the same product at once**: All variants of a product get upvoted at once when their linked choice is selected. Note: A special setting called `Use top-level product` in [Quiz Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/) needs to be active for this option to appear in the Link Products section.
    ![how to recommend products inclusion](/images/how_to_recommend_products_inclusion.png)

    - **Product variants**: Individual variants receive a vote when their linked choice is selected. Note that only product variants are directly linked to choices. However, on the results page, variants can be grouped under their parent products for a streamlined shopping experience.
    - **Categories**: Every product within a linked category receives a vote when their linked choice is selected.

    - **Product variants**: Individual variants receive a vote when their linked choice is selected. Note that only product variants are directly linked to choices. However, on the results page, variants can be grouped under their parent products for a streamlined shopping experience.
    - **Categories**: Every product within a linked category receives a vote when their linked choice is selected.
    - **Tags**: Every product within a linked tag receives a vote when their linked choice is selected.
    !!! tip
        You can also use custom fields as tags within the app by following [these instructions](//how-to-guides/use-custom-fields-as-tags/)
    ![how to recommend products inclusion](/images/how_to_recommend_products_inclusion.png)
    How the votes work for each included linked item:
    - **Product variants**: Individual variants receive a vote when their linked choice is selected. Note that only product variants are directly linked to choices. However, on the results page, variants can be grouped under their parent products for a streamlined shopping experience.
    - **Collections**: Every product within a linked collection receives a vote when their linked choice is selected.
!!! warning
    If a product variant is linked to choice "A" (via the Link Products / Upvote tab) and a collection of products that contain this product variant is also linked to choice "A" (via the Link Collections / Upvote tab), then this product variant will receive **2 votes from the same choice**.`
### Exclusion
Use the `exclude` field of the [Link Products/Collections/Exclude](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) tab to remove certain products or collections from the recommendations, useful for items with allergens or sensitive ingredients. 
    ![how to recommend products exclusion](/images/how_to_recommend_products_exclusion.png)
    ![how to recommend products exclusion](/images/how_to_recommend_products_exclusion.png)
    ![how to recommend products exclusion](/images/how_to_recommend_products_exclusion.png)
    ![how to recommend products exclusion](/images/how_to_recommend_products_exclusion.png)
!!! warning
    Once a product is excluded in a choice it will **never show** as a recommendation, even if it's upvoted in another choice earlier/later in the quiz.
!!! example
    If you want the recommended products to be filtered out by question, you can do that using the `exclude` feature. For example, if you want to show only recommendations within a certain price range, you can use the exclude collections feature as in the example below.
    ![how to recommend products exclusion example](/images/how_to_recommend_products_exclusion_example.png)
    This way if a customer chooses that he doesn't want to spend more than 100$, all the products over that price will be excluded from the recommendations.
## Funnel Quiz
The voting system recommends products by counting how many times each one is "voted for" through customer quiz choices. Each quiz choice can be linked to specific product variants, and every time a customer selects a choice, the associated products receive one vote. 
At the end of the quiz, the results page displays the product variants with the most votes, sorted from highest to lowest. If no products have been linked or all products are excluded by logic, the results page will be empty. If there's a draw in the number of votes, the order depends on your Catalogue mode setting. By default, ties are randomized. Enable 'Preserve collection order' in [Settings > Catalogue](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#catalogue-settings) to show products in the same order as your Shopify collections. You can also configure the system to show only a limited number of top-voted products or set a minimum number of votes for a product to appear.
![how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_funnel](/images/how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_funnel.png){width=500} 
    RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz can show on the results page **simple products**, **variable products**, **grouped products**, **external/affiliate products** and **[WooCommerce subscription products](/how-to-guides/recommend-subscription-products/)**. 
    RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz **cannot recommend categories** of products, though it's possible to [only recommend products from a specific category/tag/attribute](/how-to-guides/recommend-skincare-routine-slots/).
    !!! warning
        Product Recommendation Quiz for WooCommerce can sync only one type of variants of variable products. For example, if a variable product has two types of variants, the first one being size, the second being color, the app will be able to only sync the size variant of your products.
    Follow these steps to set up product recommendations in your Product Recommendation Quiz:
    1. **Link Products to Choices**: Navigate to the [Link Products/Collections/Upvote](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) tab within your quiz setup. For each choice, link/upvote relevant products. 
        - You can link./upvote product variants, collections, tags, variant collections, vendor collections or all variants of the same product at once.
    2. **Edit the Results Page**: In the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) tab you can edit the content of your results screen. You can add a heading, content block, image block, HTML block, Product Block or a Product Slot block. 
        !!! tip
            Check [How to Edit the Results Page](/how-to-guides/edit-results-page/) for more information.
    3. **Add a Product Block**: Products can be displayed on the Results Page as a list via the `Product Block` or divided into slots via the `Product Slot Block`. For beginners, it's recommended to use a `Product Block` to show the recommendations.
        - **Product Block** displays the products sorted by the number of votes - the most voted products are shown first, and the least voted last. In [Product Block settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) you can **choose how many products you want to show** at the end of the quiz.
            ![how to recommend products product block](/images/how_to_recommend_products_product_block.png){width="500"}
        - **Product Slot Blocks** allow you to display the products in clear steps, for example as a skincare routine. Each Product Slot will recommend the most-voted product from a collection that's linked to it. *Check [How to Recommend a Skincare Routine with Slots](/how-to-guides/recommend-skincare-routine-slots/) for step-by-step instructions on how to set up Slot Blocks.* 
            ![how to recommend products slots block](/images/how_to_recommend_products_slots_block.png)
    4. **Test the Results**: After your products are linked and the results page is set up, you can test your quiz.
        - Click [`Publish/Save`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) on the top-right menu to update the preview/live quiz. 
        - Then, click [`Preview`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) to test the quiz you've created in a new window. 
            !!! note
                You can test the quiz as much as you like as long as you always open a new preview window. These test responses done as admin are automatically removed after 1 hour to not add to your usage quota.
    5. **Troubleshoot the Results**: Use the quiz's [built-in search tool](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) in the `Responses` section to understand why specific products were recommended or missing from the recommendations. 
        !!! tip
            Check [How to Troubleshoot Quiz Results](/how-to-guides/troubleshoot-product-results/) for detailed instructions on how to use this tool.
    6. **Refine the Results**: If you want to make the results ultra-precise, you can also:
        - **Limit the recommendations**: You can choose to limit the recommendations to only show products that received X votes or more in the [Results Page settings](/how-to-guides/only-recommend-products-with-minimum-votes/).
        - **Use Exclusions**: You can use [Exclusions](#exclusion) to make sure that unwanted products are not shown (even if they were upvoted in another choice earlier).
    By linking product variants and collections to quiz choices, and understanding the inclusion/exclusion logic, you can use our algorithm to offer precise product recommendations.
    RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz can show on the results page **product variants** and **main products**. 
    RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz **cannot recommend categories** of products, though it's possible to [only recommend products from a specific category](/how-to-guides/recommend-skincare-routine-slots/).
    Follow these steps to set up product recommendations in your Product Recommendation Quiz:
    1. **Link Products to Choices**: Navigate to the [Link Products/Collections/Upvote](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) tab within your quiz setup. For each choice, link/upvote relevant products. 
        - You can link./upvote product variants, collections, tags, variant collections, vendor collections or all variants of the same product at once.

## Funnel Quiz with Slots
The voting system counts product "votes" based on customer quiz choices and then recommends highest voted products based on a filter added to each slot. For example, you can recommend a full skincare routine with a quiz that takes into account the customer answers and shows the most voted cleanser, toner, serum and moisturizer arranged into specific slots.

    - After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted products sorted by the number of votes
    - If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty
    - If there's a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the order of products
    You can also:
    - Limit the recommendations to only show products that received X votes or more in the [Results Page settings](/how-to-guides/only-recommend-products-with-minimum-votes/)

## Funnel Quiz with Branching
Branch your quiz to show different follow-up questions based on customer choices. The algorithm counts votes only from questions and answers shown to each customer. You can display recommendations either as a simple list or arrange them into slots for a more structured presentation.

    - Products are linked to each choice
    - When a customer picks a choice, all linked products receive one vote
    - After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted products sorted by the number of votes
    - If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty
    - If there's a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the order of products
    **Step 2: Build Quiz Structure**
    1. Go to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and create all questions needed for each branch

    1. Add a Product Block to display recommendations. Set the number of products to show.
    3. Add multiple content blocks, image or HTML blocks with text for different answer combinations.
    **Step 5: Set Up Display Logic**
    1. For each content block, add display logic rules:
        - Format: If the answer to *Question 1* is *Choice A* **AND** If the answer to *Question 2* is *Choice B* **AND** If the answer to *Question 3* is *Choice C* **OR** If the answer to *Question 1* is *Choice A* **AND** If the answer to *Question 2* is *Choice B* **AND** If the answer to *Question 3* is *Choice D*, then this block is **shown/hidden**.
        - You can combine multiple conditions with AND/OR operators
        - Example: If "Skin Type" is "Oily" **AND** "Main Concern" is "Acne", show skincare routine for oily, acne-prone skin
    2. Ensure all possible answer combinations are covered!
    **Step 6: Test and Launch**
    1. Click "Publish/Save" to update the quiz
    2. Test thoroughly! Try different answer combinations. Verify correct content blocks appear.
    3. Use the [Response Analysis tool](/how-to-guides/troubleshoot-product-results/) to verify logic and check product recommendations.

# How to Set Up Recommendations

Product recommendations are the heart of any successful quiz experience. They help guide customers to the perfect products for their needs, increasing conversion rates and customer satisfaction. In this guide, we'll explore different recommendation systems that can be implemented in your RevenueHunt quiz, each designed for different use cases and business needs.

![how_to_recommend_products_decision_tree_V2](/images/how_to_recommend_products_decision_tree_V2.png)

| Recommendation System | Best For | Key Features | Complexity |
|------------------------|----------|--------------|------------|
| [🧩 Fixed Recommendations](/how-to-guides/set-up-fixed-recommendations-quiz/#always-the-same-recommendations) | Showing the same product(s) to everyone regardless of answers | - Simple setup<br>- Products always shown<br>- No logic or conditions | Very Low |

## ✍🏻 Voting System


Recommended for most quizzes. The voting system counts product "votes" based on customer quiz choices and recommends products with the highest votes.

!!! note "Use this method for:"  

    - Helping customers narrow down a large product catalog
    - Most quizzes, especially product finders
    - Your first product recommendation quiz
    - Quizzes without complex branching

### Funnel Quiz

The voting system counts product "votes" based on customer quiz choices and recommends products with the highest votes.

![how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_funnel](/images/how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_funnel.png){width=500}

Product recommendation algorithm works like a voting system:

- Product variants are linked to each choice.
- When a customer picks a choice, all linked products receive one vote.
- After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted product variants sorted by the number of votes. *If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty. If there's a draw in the number of votes, the order depends on your Catalogue mode setting. By default, ties are randomized. Enable 'Preserve collection order' in [Settings > Catalogue](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#catalogue-settings) to show products in the same order as your Shopify collections.*
- You can limit recommendations to a specific number of products or a minimum vote threshold.

### Funnel Quiz with Slots

The voting system counts product "votes" based on customer quiz choices and then recommends highest voted products based on a filter added to each slot. For example, you can recommend a full skincare routine with a quiz that takes into account the customer answers and shows the most voted cleanser, toner, serum and moisturizer arranged into specific slots.

### Funnel Quiz that Skips Slides

Show different follow-up questions based on customer choices in a multiple-choice, multiple selection question. For example, ask about skin concerns and then only show follow-up questions related to the selected concerns. The algorithm counts votes only from questions and answers shown to each customer. 

![how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_skiplogic.png](/images/how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_skiplogic.png){width=500}

        While the process isn’t entirely plug-and-play, with the assistance of a developer, it’s manageable. If you’re not familiar with JavaScript or CSS, seeking developer help is advisable.
    **How do I recommend products based on the number of user choices?**
    The recommendation process is based on how many choices the user selects out of the given set. Here’s a step-by-step guide:
    1. **Create collections/categories**. Create distinct collections for each group of products you wish to recommend, e.g., “1/10 choices selected,” “2/10 choices selected,” etc.
    2. **Add hidden choices**. In your final question, include a multiple-choice option that correlates with the aforementioned collections/categories. This ensures that each choice connects to its respective recommended collection/category. Make sure to hide these choices from the user with custom CSS code.
    3. **Add custom JavaScript**. Using custom JavaScript, evaluate the choices selected throughout the quiz and write a piece of code that automatically selects one of the hidden choices in the last question. This will determine which product collection/category to recommend based on the number of choices the user made.
    **How can I ensure that users don’t see the choices in the last question?**
    You can hide these technical choices in the last question using custom CSS code. A guide on how to customize the quiz design can be found [here](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/).
    **Where do I input the custom JavaScript code?**
    [This article](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) explains how to add custom JavaScript code to quiz questions. For example:
    ![recommend-products-based-on-number-of-user-choices image1](/images/recommend-products-based-on-number-of-user-choices_image1.png){width=500}
    The custom JavaScript code should be integrated into the final question to assess the user’s choices and click the right choices in order to recommend a product collection accordingly.
    **How can I identify the selected choices from each slide or question with JavaScript?**
    To review the values or choice IDs selected for each slide/question, you can use the JavaScript console and search for the values:

# How to Show Quiz in Shop App

!!! warning

    Shopify has announced that they’ll be sunsetting all Shop Minis app integrations, including our Shop Minis app.

Shopify's new mobile commerce app, [Shop](https://shop.app/), represents a significant leap forward in enhancing the online shopping experience, offering both Android and iOS users a personalized and streamlined path to discovering and purchasing products from Shopify-powered stores. 

We're excited to inform you that our [RevenueHunt app](https://revenuehunt.com/product-recommendation-quiz-shopify/) has been selected as the **premier quiz solution** for Shop, designed to integrate seamlessly and contribute to a more engaging customer journey.

## Availability and Automatic Integration

Initially, the integration of the RevenueHunt Product Recommendation QUiz will be available to a select group of merchants. We are working towards making this feature broadly available to all eligible merchants soon.

For merchants who meet specific criteria, the Shop App feature will be enabled automatically, making the integration process hassle-free:

!!! info "Eligibility Criteria for Automatic Activation"

    - Your quiz recommends products listed for sale in the Shop app.
    - The quiz does not require an email address as a mandatory field. Optional email collection is permitted.
    - Your quiz does not include a phone number collection question, in line with Shop's guidelines.

## Managing Your Quiz in Shop app

If the Shop App feature has not been activated for your store automatically, you can manually set it up through the [App Settings](/reference/app-settings/). 

1. **Open App Settings**: Navigate to the [`Shop App`](/reference/app-settings/#shop-app-beta) menu within the [App settings](/reference/app-settings/#shop-app-beta) to get started.
  ![how to show quiz in shop app settings](/images/manual_appsettings_shopapp_preview.png)
2. **Select Quiz**: To control which quiz is presented to your customers in the Shop app, simply select your preferred quiz from the dropdown menu. The selected quiz will automatically be set as the default for display in the Shop app.
3. **Mark as default**: The quiz that appears in your Shop store is the one **marked as default**. You can easily identify the default quiz by looking for a small star icon in the top right corner of the quiz's icon on the dashboard. 
    
    ![how to show quiz in shop app select quiz](/images/how_to_show_quiz_in_shop_app_select_quiz.webp)
    
4. **Change default quiz**: To set a quiz as the default, use the quizzes dropdown menu on the dashboard.
    
    ![how to show quiz in shop app mark as default](/images/how_to_show_quiz_in_shop_app_mark_as_default.webp)


!!! warning

    We strive to offer a seamless and comprehensive user experience with the Shop App integration. However, it's important to note that currently, the **collection of phone numbers via the Shop app quiz is not supported**. We are actively working to include this feature in the near future.

# How to Show Results Explanation

--- WooCommerce Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/c4cb6bce39a447cc860f8408adade0f4?sid=967d38f5-9c4b-47b0-b73d-41a2aae156d6" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    While our [product recommendation algorithm](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/) works to recommend specific products, it will not automatically display an explanation of **why** a certain product was recommended. It also won’t automatically display custom text depending on the recommended product.
    RevenueHunt app **doesn't** have a linear score feature yet (as in every time a customer picks a choice, the "score" will receive one point and at the end, based on that score, different results pages will be displayed). For this reason, it can be very hard to build a **"personality-type"** quiz with our solution.
    If you want to show different text results depending on the recommended products, this functionality has to be built on the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/). There are a few ways to achieve it:
    1. **Information Recalls/Content Dynamic Source**: Use [Information Recalls/Content Dynamic Source](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) to display a customer's answers within a content block or a text block on the Results Page. This method helps customers understand the rationale behind each product recommendation without any coding or complex logic.
    2. **Display Logic**: [Display Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#display-logic) allows you to show or hide text on the Results Page based on the customer's quiz responses. This method is suitable for shorter, simpler quizzes. For detailed guidance on setting up Display Logic, see [here](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/). 
        !!! tip
            For longer, more complex quizzes, we advise using the custom JavaScript approach for optimal flexibility.
        ??? question "How to Build a Personality-Type Quiz?"
            Imagine you want to determine a customer’s skin type. You might ask them specific questions about their skin to narrow down their unique characteristics. Here’s an example:
            ---
            **Step 1: Add Questions to the Quiz**
            **Question 1: Oiliness**  
            *"How does your skin usually feel by the middle of the day?"*  
            - **Very oily, shiny all over.** *(Oily skin)*  
            - **Oily in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin), but dry elsewhere.** *(Combination skin)*  
            - **Balanced, not too oily or dry.** *(Normal skin)*  
            - **Dry and tight all over.** *(Dry skin)*  
            **Question 2: Sensitivity**  
            *"How does your skin react to new products or environmental changes?"*  
            - **Easily irritated, red, or itchy.** *(Sensitive skin)*  
            - **Rarely reacts, even to strong products.** *(Normal or Oily skin)*  
            - **Reacts sometimes, but not consistently.** *(Combination skin)*  
            **Question 3: Hydration**  
            *"Does your skin often feel dehydrated, regardless of oiliness?"*  
            - **Yes, it feels tight and flaky.** *(Dry or Dehydrated skin)*  
            - **Sometimes, especially in colder months.** *(Combination or Normal skin)*  
            - **Rarely or never.** *(Oily skin)*  
            ---
            **Step 2: Link Products to Choices**
            Associate each answer option with the most appropriate products. For example:  
            - Answers that indicate **Dry Skin** link to products formulated for dry skin.  
            - Answers suggesting **Oily Skin** link to products designed for oily skin.  
            This setup ensures that the quiz [product recommendation algorithm](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/) will automatically provide the most relevant product suggestions.
            *Note: This part is easy. The most difficult part is displaying the right text that corresponds to the product recommendation.*
            ---
            **Step 3: Displaying Skin Type Text Results with Display Logic**
            If you want to display a text summary, like "You have Dry/Oily/Combination/Normal skin," use **Display Logic** to conditionally show content blocks based on customer answers.  
            **Example Setup:**
            1️⃣ **Add Content Blocks to Results Page**  
            Create content blocks on your results page for each skin type. For example:  
            - *You have Dry Skin*  
            - *You have Oily Skin*  
            - *You have Combination Skin*  
            - *You have Normal Skin*  
            ![how to show results explenation personalityquiz1](/images/how_to_show_results_explenation_personalityquiz1.png)
            2️⃣ **Configure Display Logic Rules**  
            Set [Display Logic](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/) rules for when each block should appear, based on the answers.  
            **For Dry Skin:**  
            - If the answer to **Question 1: Oiliness** is *Dry and tight all over*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 2: Sensitivity** is *Easily irritated, red, or itchy*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 3: Hydration** is *Yes, it feels tight and flaky*.  
            Then this block will be **Visible**; otherwise, it remains hidden.  
            ![how to show results explenation personalityquiz2](/images/how_to_show_results_explenation_personalityquiz2.png)
            **For Combination Skin:**  
            Combination skin may result from varied answer paths. You’ll need rules for multiple scenarios:  
            - If the answer to **Question 1: Oiliness** is *Oily in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin), but dry elsewhere*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 2: Sensitivity** is *Reacts sometimes, but not consistently*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 3: Hydration** is *Sometimes, especially in colder months*.  
            **OR**
            - If the answer to **Question 1: Oiliness** is *Very oily, shiny all over*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 2: Sensitivity** is *Easily irritated, red, or itchy*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 3: Hydration** is *Sometimes, especially in colder months*.  
            **OR**
            - If the answer to **Question 1: Oiliness** is *Oily in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin), but dry elsewhere*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 2: Sensitivity** is *Easily irritated, red, or itchy*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 3: Hydration** is *Sometimes, but not consistently*.         
            Then this block will be **Visible**; otherwise, it remains hidden.  
            ![how to show results explenation personalityquiz3](/images/how_to_show_results_explenation_personalityquiz3.png)
            ![how to show results explenation personalityquiz4](/images/how_to_show_results_explenation_personalityquiz4.png)
            ![how to show results explenation personalityquiz5](/images/how_to_show_results_explenation_personalityquiz5.png)
            3️⃣ **Repeat this process for all other possible combinations of answers.**
            You will have to add similar rules to all the content blocks on the Results Page to show the right text in the end. This means you will have to predict every possible combination of answers a customer can make and add it as Display logic to ensure that the correct text block is shown. 
            ---
            **Simplifying the Process**
            If configuring logic for all combinations feels overwhelming, you can try alternatives highlighted in this article, for example:  
            1. Base your logic on a single question (e.g., Question 1).  
            2. Use JavaScript to dynamically determine the skin type and display the result text.  
            ---
            This step-by-step guide will help you build a personality-type quiz tailored to your customers, making it easier to recommend the perfect products and deliver valuable insights.          
    3. **Custom JavaScript**: For a more refined approach, consider hiring a developer to create a custom JavaScript function. This function can show specific text tailored to the ID of the recommended product. Your developer could also add custom values to quiz choices and create a scoring system for the quiz to then display the right text on the results page. 
        !!! tip
            Instructions on adding custom JavaScript to your Product Recommendation Quiz can be found [here](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/).
    4. **Product Descriptions**: Another option is to enrich your product descriptions with information explaining why each product is recommended. These descriptions are pulled directly from your store's product list. You can manage the visibility of these descriptions in the [Results Page settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) under `Individual Product Settings -> Show description`. Additionally, you have the option to truncate these descriptions for better readability.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/c4cb6bce39a447cc860f8408adade0f4?sid=967d38f5-9c4b-47b0-b73d-41a2aae156d6" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

            - **Reacts sometimes, but not consistently.** *(Combination skin)*  
            **Question 3: Hydration**  
            *"Does your skin often feel dehydrated, regardless of oiliness?"*  
            - **Yes, it feels tight and flaky.** *(Dry or Dehydrated skin)*  
            - **Sometimes, especially in colder months.** *(Combination or Normal skin)*  
            - **Rarely or never.** *(Oily skin)*  
            ---
            **Step 2: Link Products to Choices**
            Associate each answer option with the most appropriate products. For example:  
            - Answers that indicate **Dry Skin** link to products formulated for dry skin.  
            - Answers suggesting **Oily Skin** link to products designed for oily skin.  
            This setup ensures that the quiz [product recommendation algorithm](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/) will automatically provide the most relevant product suggestions.
            *Note: This part is easy. The most difficult part is displaying the right text that corresponds to the product recommendation.*
            ---
            **Step 3: Displaying Skin Type Text Results with Display Logic**
            If you want to display a text summary, like "You have Dry/Oily/Combination/Normal skin," use **Display Logic** to conditionally show content blocks based on customer answers.  
            **Example Setup:**
            1️⃣ **Add Content Blocks to Results Page**  
            Create content blocks on your results page for each skin type. For example:  
            - *You have Dry Skin*  
            - *You have Oily Skin*  
            - *You have Combination Skin*  
            - *You have Normal Skin*  
            ![how to show results explenation personalityquiz1](/images/how_to_show_results_explenation_personalityquiz1.png)
            2️⃣ **Configure Display Logic Rules**  
            Set [Display Logic](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/) rules for when each block should appear, based on the answers.  
            **For Dry Skin:**  
            - If the answer to **Question 1: Oiliness** is *Dry and tight all over*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 2: Sensitivity** is *Easily irritated, red, or itchy*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 3: Hydration** is *Yes, it feels tight and flaky*.  
            Then this block will be **Visible**; otherwise, it remains hidden.  
            ![how to show results explenation personalityquiz2](/images/how_to_show_results_explenation_personalityquiz2.png)
            **For Combination Skin:**  
            Combination skin may result from varied answer paths. You’ll need rules for multiple scenarios:  
            - If the answer to **Question 1: Oiliness** is *Oily in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin), but dry elsewhere*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 2: Sensitivity** is *Reacts sometimes, but not consistently*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 3: Hydration** is *Sometimes, especially in colder months*.  
            **OR**
            - If the answer to **Question 1: Oiliness** is *Very oily, shiny all over*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 2: Sensitivity** is *Easily irritated, red, or itchy*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 3: Hydration** is *Sometimes, especially in colder months*.  
            **OR**
            - If the answer to **Question 1: Oiliness** is *Oily in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin), but dry elsewhere*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 2: Sensitivity** is *Easily irritated, red, or itchy*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 3: Hydration** is *Sometimes, but not consistently*.         
            Then this block will be **Visible**; otherwise, it remains hidden.

            3️⃣ **Repeat this process for all other possible combinations of answers.**
            You will have to add similar rules to all the content blocks on the Results Page to show the right text in the end. This means you will have to predict every possible combination of answers a customer can make and add it as Display logic to ensure that the correct text block is shown. 
            ---
            **Simplifying the Process**
            If configuring logic for all combinations feels overwhelming, you can try alternatives highlighted in this article, for example:  
            1. Base your logic on a single question (e.g., Question 1).  
            2. Use JavaScript to dynamically determine the skin type and display the result text.  
            ---
            This step-by-step guide will help you build a personality-type quiz tailored to your customers, making it easier to recommend the perfect products and deliver valuable insights.          
    3. **Custom JavaScript**: For a more refined approach, consider hiring a developer to create a custom JavaScript function. This function can show specific text tailored to the ID of the recommended product. Your developer could also add custom values to quiz choices and create a scoring system for the quiz to then display the right text on the results page. 
        !!! tip
            Instructions on adding custom JavaScript to your Product Recommendation Quiz can be found [here](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/).
    4. **Product Descriptions**: Another option is to enrich your product descriptions with information explaining why each product is recommended. These descriptions are pulled directly from your store's product list. You can manage the visibility of these descriptions in the [Results Page settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) under `Individual Product Settings -> Show description`. Additionally, you have the option to truncate these descriptions for better readability.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/c4cb6bce39a447cc860f8408adade0f4?sid=967d38f5-9c4b-47b0-b73d-41a2aae156d6" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    While our [product recommendation algorithm](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/) works to recommend specific products, it will not automatically display an explanation of **why** a certain product was recommended. It also won’t automatically display custom text depending on the recommended product.
    RevenueHunt app **doesn't** have a linear score feature yet (as in every time a customer picks a choice, the "score" will receive one point and at the end, based on that score, different results pages will be displayed). For this reason, it can be very hard to build a **"personality-type"** quiz with our solution.
    If you want to show different text results depending on the recommended products, this functionality has to be built on the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/). There are a few ways to achieve it:
    1. **Information Recalls/Content Dynamic Source**: Use [Information Recalls/Content Dynamic Source](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) to display a customer's answers within a content block or a text block on the Results Page. This method helps customers understand the rationale behind each product recommendation without any coding or complex logic.
    2. **Display Logic**: [Display Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#display-logic) allows you to show or hide text on the Results Page based on the customer's quiz responses. This method is suitable for shorter, simpler quizzes. For detailed guidance on setting up Display Logic, see [here](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/). 
        !!! tip
            For longer, more complex quizzes, we advise using the custom JavaScript approach for optimal flexibility.
        ??? question "How to Build a Personality-Type Quiz?"
            Imagine you want to determine a customer’s skin type. You might ask them specific questions about their skin to narrow down their unique characteristics. Here’s an example:
            ---
            **Step 1: Add Questions to the Quiz**
            **Question 1: Oiliness**  
            *"How does your skin usually feel by the middle of the day?"*  
            - **Very oily, shiny all over.** *(Oily skin)*  
            - **Oily in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin), but dry elsewhere.** *(Combination skin)*  
            - **Balanced, not too oily or dry.** *(Normal skin)*  
            - **Dry and tight all over.** *(Dry skin)*  
            **Question 2: Sensitivity**  
            *"How does your skin react to new products or environmental changes?"*  
            - **Easily irritated, red, or itchy.** *(Sensitive skin)*  
            - **Rarely reacts, even to strong products.** *(Normal or Oily skin)*

            Instructions on adding custom JavaScript to your Product Recommendation Quiz can be found [here](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/).
    4. **Product Descriptions**: Another option is to enrich your product descriptions with information explaining why each product is recommended. These descriptions are pulled directly from your store's product list. You can manage the visibility of these descriptions in the [Results Page settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) under `Individual Product Settings -> Show description`. Additionally, you have the option to truncate these descriptions for better readability.

# How to Troubleshoot Product Recommendations in Your Quiz

Navigating through the product recommendations can be challenging, especially when dealing with numerous products and collections/categories linked to quiz choices. 

This guide will walk you through the process of troubleshooting product recommendations. It can help you understand why a certain product was recommended or missing from the Results Page.

!!! warning "Understanding the basics"

    When a particular product appears (or fails to appear) on the Results Page, it's crucial to understand the mechanism behind its selection. This involves tracing back to the quiz responses and analyzing the [voting system](/how-to-guides/set-up-funnel-quiz/#voting-system) or [display logic](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#display-logic-display-section-logic) that influences product visibility.

## Step-by-Step Process to Check Recommendations

!!! tip

    Before you begin, open the [Responses section](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) from the [App manual](/reference/) in the new browser window. It will come in handy.

--- WooCommerce Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/35a595634ca5404d922c725590e96c89?sid=ca0b9ad7-eea5-43b1-9597-6dfa9aee4a2b" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    1. **Access Quiz Metrics**: First, navigate to the quiz [Metrics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/) in the Quiz Builder.
    2. **Explore Responses**: Within Metrics, locate and open the [Responses](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) tab. On the left-hand side menu, you'll find the most recent 100 responses the quiz received organized by date/timestamp. Click on a date to open a specific response.
    3. Check the `Why was a product recommended or not in this response?` section. This section of the app allows you to troubleshoot individual responses and understand why certain products were recommended to the customer or missing from the recommendations.
    4. **Preview the Results Page**: Use the provided link at the bottom of the response details to access the Results Page corresponding to the chosen response. 
        ![how to troubleshoot quiz results preview results](/images/how_to_troubleshoot_quiz_results_preview_results.gif)
    5. On the results page, identify a product of interest—either one that appeared unexpectedly on the Results Page or one you anticipated but was missing.
    6. **Conduct a Product Search**: Use the `SELECT PRODUCT TO CHECK` section at the top of the response to search the name of the product in question. Select the product from the search results to further investigate its recommendation status.
        ![how to troubleshoot quiz results search products](/images/how_to_troubleshoot_quiz_results_search_products.gif)
        **Understanding Product Status Colors**
        - **Green**: Indicates products that received votes through the quiz choices.
        - **Red**: Denotes products that were explicitly excluded from recommendations.
        - **White**: Represents products that did not receive any votes, hence their absence from the recommendations.
    7. **Analyze Product Details**: Upon selecting a product, a detailed panel will reveal critical information.
        ![how to troubleshoot quiz results information](/images/how_to_troubleshoot_quiz_results_information.gif)
        Information such as:
        - The collections/categories the product belongs to.
        - The number of votes it received and the reasons for its recommendation or absence.
        - The questions/choices that influenced its votes, including the collections/categories where it was either upvoted or excluded.
        - The specific Results Page and Slots or Product blocks that facilitated its recommendation.
    8. **Troubleshooting and Adjustments**: With this information, you can pinpoint inconsistencies or errors in product categorization, inclusion, or exclusion. 
    !!! tip
        A common issue is a product being **misclassified** into an incorrect collection/category or **accidentally excluded** in quiz settings. Paying close attention to these details can significantly improve the accuracy of your product recommendations.
    Additionally, you may:
    - **Recalculate Recommendations**: If adjustments to the quiz or product collections/categories have been made, use this option to see how these changes affect recommendations.
    - **Resend Notifications**: Useful for updating CRM services or sending revised recommendations via email.

        A common issue is a product being **misclassified** into an incorrect collection/category or **accidentally excluded** in quiz settings. Paying close attention to these details can significantly improve the accuracy of your product recommendations.
    Additionally, you may:
    - **Recalculate Recommendations**: If adjustments to the quiz or product collections/categories have been made, use this option to see how these changes affect recommendations.
    - **Resend Notifications**: Useful for updating CRM services or sending revised recommendations via email.
---
By following this guide, you will be better equipped to understand and refine the product recommendation process within your quiz, ensuring a more relevant and personalized customer experience.

# Troubleshooting Product Recommendation Quiz App Issues for WordPress / WooCommerce

Our Product Recommendation Quiz app is designed to integrate seamlessly with most e-commerce stores. However, due to the high level of customization in WordPress / WooCommerce stores, conflicts with other plugins or store settings can occasionally arise, impacting the app’s functionality. This guide aims to address common issues and provide clear solutions.

!!! tip "General Troubleshooting Tip"
    
    If you’ve exhausted all listed solutions without success, it may be due to specific configurations in your website. In such cases, consult your developer or hosting provider and review server logs for potential clues. Unfortunately, our capacity to assist is limited in these scenarios.

!!! warning

    Important Addition: Ensure to whitelist our IP address (`3.14.55.225`) in your store’s settings to facilitate uninterrupted communication between our app and your store.

## Error #1: Request and Data Transmission Issues

!!! example "Error Messages"

    An error occurred in the request and at the time were unable to send the consumer data.

    We tried checking the connection with your WooCommerce API, but was unsuccessful.

    We tried fetching the product varaitions via the WooCommerce API, but was unsuccessful.

    We tried connecting to your WooCommerce API to sync the “products, but got a status 403.

Possible Causes and Solutions:

1. **Outdated WooCommerce Version**: Ensure your store is running a version later than WooCommerce 3.5.
2. **Outdated Plugin Version**: Ensure you’ve downloaded the latest version of the app.
3. **Lack of HTTPS/SSL Certificate**: Install and activate a valid certificate for secure API communication.
4. **Website Accessibility**: Remove password protection or ‘coming soon’ plugins that restrict public access.
5. **Caching Plugin Interference**: Disable caching plugins one by one to identify the culprit.
6. **Server Configuration**: If the above don’t resolve the issue, your server might be stripping the “Authorization” header.
7. **Check Security Settings**: Review your store’s and hosting security settings to ensure they aren’t conflicting with the app.
8. **Disable Other Plugins**: Temporarily deactivate other plugins and try granting access to our app to see if they are causing a conflict.
9. **Cloudflare Cache**: Exclude the WooCommerce API endpoint (/wp-json/wc/v3/) from Cloudflare’s cache. Alternatively, use Cloudflare’s developer mode to bypass the cache temporarily. (Source: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/)

![how to troubleshoot wordpress woocommerce image1](/images/how_to_troubleshoot_wordpress_woocommerce_image1.webp)

Advanced Solutions:

1. Review caching plugin settings related to headers.
2. Generate a new LetsEncrypt certificate.
3. Direct subdomain to bypass Cloudflare CDN Proxy.
4. Switch to a basic WooCommerce Theme like “Storefront” for initial connection.
5. Add to .htaccess: `SetEnvIf Authorization "(.*)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1`.

**Special Note**: If using CAFE24 hosting, disable the “SPAM Shield” function.

## Error #2: Authentication and Permission Issues

!!! example "Error Messages"

    It seems that something is interfering with your WordPress Rest API. This needs to be fixed in order to grant access to this plugin.

    Missing parameter app_name

    404 Not Found – the requested URL was not found on this server

Possible Causes and Solutions:

1. **WPML or Polylang Plugin Conflict**: Temporarily deactivate WPML/Polylang, authenticate our plugin, then reactivate WPML/Polylang. (As of November 2024, Polylang and Product Recommendation Quiz app cannot be used together.)
2. **Incorrect Callback URL**: Replace `%2F` with `/` in the URL, or remove extra /wp/ from the URL.
3. **Installation Location**: For WooCommerce on a subpage, adjust the URL accordingly (remove /page/). So, instead of `https://yourstore.com/shop/wc-auth/v1/authorize/...` You would use `https://yourstore.com/wc-auth/v1/authorize/...` Even if the first URL is the right path to your WooCommerce store.
4. **Website is not live**: Ensure installation on a live, publicly accessible website. It cannot be hidden by an “under construction” plugin or setting. The app does not work in local environments.
5. **Check WordPress REST API**: To test it visit  `https://yourstore.com/wp-json/`. If you’re getting a “Not Found” or similar error, it’s possible that you need to fix your WordPress installation. It’s a problem with the WordPress REST API in your site and not with the WooCommerce REST API. You’ll have to contact your developer to further investigate this issue as it’s outside of our scope.

!!! example "Error Messages"

    The following REST API endpoint is returning a valid JSON but the returned content-type is text/html instead of the expecred application/json.

Possible Causes and Solutions:

1. **Check JSON format**. This means that even if your site returns a JSON it may not be in the correct format. The WordPress API is returning a response that is encoded as text/html. Normally, it should be application/json.   This is related to your store or server settings, but can also be influenced by another plugin. It is recommended to check it with your developer and fix it.

![how to troubleshoot wordpress woocommerce image2](/images/how_to_troubleshoot_wordpress_woocommerce_image2.jpg)

!!! example "Error Messages"

    Plugin could not be activated because it triggered a fatal error. Fatal error: Cannot redeclare prq_set_token() (previously declared in…)

Possible Causes and Solutions:

1. **Duplicate Plugin Activation**: Deactivate the existing WordPress Plugin (Product recommendation Quiz for eCommerce) before activating the WooCommerce extension (Product Recommendation Quiz for WooCommerce). Don’t worry, you won’t lose any data because your quizzes and responses are stored in our server.

![how to troubleshoot wordpress woocommerce image3](/images/how_to_troubleshoot_wordpress_woocommerce_image3.png)

!!! example "Error Messages"

    The plugin does not have a valid header

Possible Causes and Solutions:

1. **Plugins cached**: Your list of Plugins could be cached in whatever WP Object Cache your blog / site is using. (Source: [https://scotty-t.com/2011/03/28/fix-for-the-plugin-does-not-have-a-valid-header/](https://scotty-t.com/2011/03/28/fix-for-the-plugin-does-not-have-a-valid-header/))
2. **Check the Correct Folder Structure**: Ensure that the plugin’s main file is placed correctly in the wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. **Modify PHP File Headers**: If the headers of PHP files within the plugin resemble the mandatory header of the main plugin file, it can confuse WordPress. Modifying these headers to a different format can resolve the issue. (Source: [https://chattymango.com/how-fix-wordpress-error-plugin-not-valid-header/](https://chattymango.com/how-fix-wordpress-error-plugin-not-valid-header/))
4. **Remove /trunk directory**: Remove `/trunk` directory or activate from the plugin list. (Source: [https://wordpress.org/support/topic/the-plugin-does-not-have-a-valid-header-solution/](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/the-plugin-does-not-have-a-valid-header-solution/))
5. **Outdated Plugin Version**: Ensure you’ve downloaded the latest version of the app.
6. **Two Plugins Installed**: Deactivate and remove the WooCommerce extension before installing the WordPress plugin (or vice versa).

# How to Update Your Shopify Cart Drawer Products After the Quiz

If your quiz is adding products to the cart but your cart drawer isn’t updating or opening automatically, the issue is likely with how your Shopify theme handles cart updates — not with the quiz itself.

!!! warning "Cart Drawer Update"

    You don’t need a dedicated Quiz JS API to update your cart drawer. The RevenueHunt app already triggers Shopify’s native cart events (like `cart/add.js`, `cart/update.js`, and `cart/change.js`) whenever a shopper adds or updates products through the quiz.

    You can listen to these events in your theme or custom script to detect when items are added to the cart and then trigger your cart drawer update logic. This approach works across themes and doesn’t require any changes in the app itself.

This guide explains:

- How RevenueHunt quiz app adds products to the Shopify cart

- Why the cart drawer may not update

- What your theme editor or developer can do to fix it

## Step 1: Understand How Quiz Adds Products to the Cart

Our app uses Shopify’s official AJAX Cart API to add products. These are the same endpoints used by most Shopify themes and apps.

We use:

- `cart/add.js` – adds products to the cart

- `cart/change.js` – changes product quantities

- `cart/update.js` – updates the cart with new contents

- `cart.js` – retrieves the latest state of the cart

These actions notify Shopify that the cart has changed. It’s then up to the theme to update the UI, such as opening or refreshing the cart drawer.

## Step 2: Confirm If Your Theme Supports Cart Drawer Updates

Most modern themes (like Dawn) include a cart drawer or slide-out cart. However, if your cart drawer does not update after a quiz submission:

- Your theme is likely not listening for changes triggered by AJAX cart actions.

- This can happen even in Shopify’s default themes if the cart drawer script wasn’t customized / extended properly or if the cart drawer script isn’t configured to react to external AJAX calls.

## Step 3: Talk to Your Theme Developer

Since our app only triggers Shopify’s standard cart actions, you’ll need to make sure your theme is set up to respond to those actions.

You don’t need a custom Quiz API or event hook to make this work.
The app already triggers Shopify’s native cart events (`cart/add.js`, `cart/update.js`, and `cart/change.js`) whenever shoppers add or update products through the quiz.

To make your cart drawer respond automatically:

- Simply listen for these AJAX calls in your theme or a small custom script.

- When detected, trigger your cart drawer’s “open” or “refresh” logic.

This lightweight approach works across all themes and doesn’t require any modifications to the RevenueHunt app itself.

Share the following resources with your developer or Shopify Expert:

- Shopify AJAX Cart Documentation: [https://shopify.dev/docs/api/ajax/reference/cart](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/ajax/reference/cart)

- Helpful guide on listening to AJAX cart events in Shopify themes: [https://www.perplexity.ai/search/how-to-get-shopify-theme-to-li-whWrlpOyT_6ygEG0ZRt68w#0](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/how-to-get-shopify-theme-to-li-whWrlpOyT_6ygEG0ZRt68w#0)


!!! example "Example from a Merchant"

    A Shopify merchant using the Megastore theme noticed that products were correctly added to the cart after the quiz, but the drawer remained closed and sometimes showed an “Empty Cart” message.

    After reviewing the theme code, they found that it only opened the cart drawer when items were added via the theme’s own product forms:

    ```js
            onSubmitHandler(evt) {
        fetch('/cart/add.js', { /* ... */ })
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(response => {
            this.cart.renderContents(response); // ← Opens the drawer
            });
        }

    ```

    When external apps (like the quiz) used the Cart API directly, this path was never triggered.

    Solution implemented:

    Their developer added a global Cart API interceptor that:

    - Detects any `/cart/add.js` or `/cart/update.js` requests,
    - Fetches the updated cart contents,
    - Automatically opens or refreshes the drawer,
    - Removes residual "empty cart" messages.

    They also re-attached the overlay and close button handlers after updating the DOM so the drawer worked normally.

    Once this script was added, the cart drawer updated perfectly — without any app-side changes.

## Step 4: Test Your Setup

Once your theme is updated to listen to the AJAX cart actions, test the following:

1. Complete your quiz and click “Add to Cart”.

2. Confirm that:

    - Products are added successfully.

    - The cart drawer opens automatically, or

    - The cart UI updates with the new products.


!!! info "Note"

    The RevenueHunt app already triggers Shopify’s native cart actions.  

    We do **not** modify your cart drawer or theme layout.

    We **cannot** support theme customization or debug third-party JavaScript.

    We’re happy to confirm that our app is triggering the correct cart actions — [just let us know](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/contact-customer-support/).

    For theme modifications, please consult your theme developer or Shopify Expert.

    This guide will walk you through the process of using a callback function for custom integrations with Product Recommendation Quiz. Whether you're aiming to build your own results page, add unique code, display custom product recommendations, or direct users to specific pages on your store, callback functions offer a versatile solution.
## What Are Callback Functions?
A **callback function** is a piece of JavaScript code that executes in response to an event - in this case, the completion of a quiz. You add this callback function to your website and a listener that will be triggered when the quiz is completed. Then you will have access to all the data from quiz responses.
By tapping into the quiz responses, developers can access a wealth of information including individual answers, customer tags, and recommended products. This data is delivered in a **JSON format** via a JavaScript Callback Function, enabling you to add it directly to your website.
The JSON with the quiz response includes:
- The complete set of questions that were asked
- The responses your customer gave
- The customer tags that were assigned to that customer
- The products that were recommended
- The layout and logic of the results page blocks 
!!! note
    Note that this callback function will also be triggered if your customers reach the results page via [follow-up emails](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/) you send your customers with a link to their results.
## Implementing the Callback Function
    1. **Initial Setup**: To begin, insert the following code into your store's theme, ideally just before the closing `</head>` tag:
      ```html
      <script>
        function prqQuizCallback(quizResponse){
          console.log(quizResponse);
        }
      </script>
      ```
        This simple example utilizes a `console.log()` function to output the JSON containing all the quiz response data. However, this is merely a starting point. Developers are encouraged to tailor the above callback function to meet their specific needs.
    2. **Store the Data**: Confirm that the callback response is being correctly stored on your website. An effective method involves wrapping the redirection logic within the callback function itself. This ensures the data is mapped or saved before any redirection takes place. For example:
        ```javascript
        function prqQuizCallback(quizResponse) {
        // Code to map or save the data...
        // Then, redirect the user to the desired page:
        window.location.href = 'yourTargetURLHere';
        }
        ```
        Choose an appropriate storage solution for the callback response, such as cookies, local storage, or even as query parameters in the URL, depending on your specific needs and the nature of the data.
    3. **Access the Results Page First**: The callback function is designed to trigger upon reaching the quiz's results page. This sequence ensures that the callback captures the quiz response, saving it as JSON in your website's local storage, before any redirection occurs. It's critical to ensure the results page is accessed even for a fraction of a second to allow this process to unfold correctly.
    4. **Customize the Function**: Beyond merely logging the data, you might want to trigger specific actions based on the quiz outcomes. *For instance, introducing a `prqAddOneToCartCallback(event);` function could be used when a customer adds a product to their cart directly from the quiz results.*
        - There are several other callback functions you can utilize for more granular control and interaction with the quiz results. 
          ```html
          prqSlideCallback(event);
          // triggered when customer responds to a question (slide)
          prqAddOneToCartCallback(event);
          // triggered when customer adds one product to cart 
          prqAddedOneToCartCallback(event);
          // triggered when the product has already been added to the cart 
          prqRemoveOneFromCartCallback(event);
          // triggered when customer removes one product from cart 
          prqRemovedOneFromCartCallback(event);
          // triggered when the product has already been removed from the cart (only Shopify) 
          prqAddAllToCartCallback(event); 
          // triggered when customer adds all products to cart 
          prqAddedAllToCartCallback(event);
          // triggered when all the products have already been added to the cart 
          prqAppLoadedCallback();
          // triggered when the Product Recommendation Quiz app has been loaded 
          ```
    1. **Initial Setup**: To begin, insert the following code into your store's theme, ideally just before the closing `</head>` tag:
      ```html
      <script>
        function prqQuizCallback(quizResponse){
          console.log(quizResponse);
        }
      </script>
      ```

        window.location.href = 'yourTargetURLHere';
        }
        ```

# BigCommerce: Use Custom Fields as tags

You can create a Custom Field called “tags” within your BigCommerce store and use it to automaticaly group products within the Product Recommendation Quiz. These Custom Fields/tags can be then used to link products in bulk to choices or slots in the quiz.

Here’s how it works:

1. Navigate to your product page in BigCommerce and add open the `Custom Fields` menu.
    ![Use_Custom_Fields_as_tags_image1.jpg](/images/Use_Custom_Fields_as_tags_image1.jpg)
2. Next, select `+ Add custom fields` to create a new entry.
    ![Use_Custom_Fields_as_tags_image2.jpg](/images/Use_Custom_Fields_as_tags_image2.jpg)
3. In the Custom Field Name type “tags” and under Custom Field Value add the tags separated by a coma.
    ![Use_Custom_Fields_as_tags_image3.jpg](/images/Use_Custom_Fields_as_tags_image3.jpg)
4. Make sure to save the changes. You can tag many products in your store this way. 
5. Once you’re done tagging the products with the custom field called “tags”, simply run a [manual sync](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/) of the app to make sure the Product Recommendation Quiz catalog is up to date. Products with the same tags will be automatically grouped together within the app and you’ll be able to link them to choices in the quiz within the [Link Categories/Tags](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/) section.

# How to Add and Use Customer Tags

Effective audience segmentation can dramatically improve the results of your marketing campaigns, and **customer tags** are a powerful tool for achieving this. 

This article will guide you through adding customer tags to choices, using customer tags to segment your audience, and improving your marketing strategies. 

By adding customer tags into your quizzes, you can automatically send quiz results to your mailing list or CRM, enabling precise segmentation based on customer responses.


!!! tip "Why Use Customer Tags?"

    Understanding the value of each member of your audience is crucial. While accumulating a large following on social media or a lengthy email list may seem beneficial, its true value comes into question if you know nothing about the individuals that make up those numbers.

    **The Importance of Segmentation**

    - **FACT 1:** Campaigns that are **highly segmented** can yield more than three times the revenue per recipient compared to unsegmented campaigns.
    - **FACT 2:** Ideally, your business should earn at least $1 per month for each subscriber. If this isn't the case, it indicates that your email list isn't segmented sufficiently.

    Segmentation allows for more personalized marketing strategies. By segmenting your audience based on specific criteria like specific customer tags, you can target them more effectively with tailored content and offers.

    By adding customer tags into your quizzes, you can automatically send quiz results to your mailing list or CRM, enabling precise segmentation based on customer responses.

### Creating Segments in Your CRM
    Once integrated, your CRM or mailing list will contain detailed segmented data on your customers. This enables you to create dynamic segments and direct hyper-targeted campaigns to different groups based on their quiz responses. 
    For example, users tagged with `dry_skin` can be targeted with a campaign promoting a specific moisurizing skincare product, while users tagged with `oily_skin` can be targeted with a campaign promoting a specific cleansing product.
    Instructions on how to create segments will vary per CRM platform but in general the segment definition will be similar to the following:
    !!! example "Example of a segment definition"
        If the value of the custom property `tags` contains `dry_skin` then the customer should be included in the segment.
    Any profile that has a tag will be included in the segment automatically.
    !!! warning
        In most integrations, tags are updated with every quiz retake. If you wish to preserve tags from each quiz attempt, [contacting support](/how-to-guides/contact-customer-support/) is recommended for further assistance.

## Examples and Applications
### Display Logic Based on Customer Answers
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVAg0KfkX5Q?si=tBJo7gXHs4dvRTn1" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    **Scenario**
    You want to show a custom text block based on the customer's answer to a question. Imagine creating a quiz that determines a personalized skincare routine. *Question 4* might ask about the participant's skin type, and depending on the answer, a different text and recommendation about their skincare is shown on the Results Page. This individualized response is made possible by Display Logic.
    **Implementation**
    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add a `Multiple choice question` asking the customer about their skin type: Dry, Normal, Oily, or Combination-type skin. 
        !!! tip
            Use the description box in `Question Settings -> Show Description` to help customers determine their skin type.
    2. **Add Content Blocks to Results Page**: Go to the Results Page and add a new `content block`. To add a content block click the `+` sign and select `Content Block` from the list. Add multiple content blocks describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:
        !!! example
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness – we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that’s deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn’t experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin’s natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
        !!! tip    
            Make the heading stand out with [markdown language](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/). Use the`#` sign before a sentence can make it bold.
    3. **Add Display Logic**: If we don’t add [Display Logic](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/) to the quiz, our blocks will just appear one after the other on the Results Page, regardless of the choice we made. To add Display Logic, select a content block and click on `display logic`. Next, click `add display logic`. Set up IF-THEN statements to control when each content block should be visible or hidden based on the customer's choices.
        ![how to hide content with logic display logic statement](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_display_logic_statement.png)

            Use the description box in `Question Settings -> Show Description` to help customers determine their skin type.
    2. **Add Content Blocks to Results Page**: Go to the Results Page and add a new `content block`. To add a content block click the `+` sign and select `Content Block` from the list. Add multiple content blocks describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:
        !!! example
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness – we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that’s deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn’t experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin’s natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
        !!! tip    
            Make the heading stand out with [markdown language](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/). Use the`#` sign before a sentence can make it bold.
    3. **Add Display Logic**: If we don’t add [Display Logic](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/) to the quiz, our blocks will just appear one after the other on the Results Page, regardless of the choice we made. To add Display Logic, select a content block and click on `display logic`. Next, click `add display logic`. Set up IF-THEN statements to control when each content block should be visible or hidden based on the customer's choices.
        ![how to hide content with logic display logic statement](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_display_logic_statement.png)
    4. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.
### Diplsay Logic Based on Winning Variable
    **Scenario**
    You're building a personality-type or Dosha quiz. You want to show a different text and product recommendations based on the winning variable. For examples, if the user chooses mostly A's, B's, C's, etc. a different section with different text and product recommendations is shown.
    **Implementation**
    Custom Scores or variables are not natively supported in the WooCommerce version of the RevenueHunt app. In this version of the app displaying content based on a custom score or variable is only possible via custom JavaScript and may require help from a developer.

# How to Use Information Recalls / Content Dynamic Source

Information recalls / Content Dynamic Source allow you to reuse participants' previously entered responses, such as their name or quiz answers, in subsequent questions, results pages, or follow-up communications. This personalizes the quiz experience by making it more relevant and engaging for the participant.

![how to use information recalls example filled](/images/how_to_use_information_recalls_example_filled.png)

## Adding Information Recalls / Content Dynamic Source

--- WooCommerce Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/71f4dd83be8747719557e5571a48edfb?sid=97b689d3-4e21-4794-aedd-8d0c623072b2" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    1. **Initiate Recall Feature**: While crafting your quiz questions or setting up follow-up communications, press the `@` symbol on your keyboard. This action activates the recall feature. 
        - If nothing happens after you click the `@` symbol, you can also initiate this function from [Question Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).
        - Information Recalls cannot be added to the first question in the quiz.
    2. **Select From Available Data**: Upon triggering the recall feature, a dropdown menu will appear, listing all available questions and data points collected from participants up to that point in the quiz. Scroll through the dropdown menu to find the specific piece of information you wish to recall. Whether it's the participant's name, their answers to previous questions, or other collected data, simply click on your choice to select it.
        ![how to use information recalls clicked](/images/how_to_use_information_recalls_clicked.png)
    3. **Implement Recalls**: Once selected, the chosen data will be integrated into your current question, email subject line, or message body. Instead of seeing a generic placeholder, participants will see the recalled information, such as their name, making the interaction feel uniquely tailored to them.

??? question "What is Jump Logic?"
    Jump Logic operates on conditional statements, similar to the `IF-THEN-ELSE` logic found in programming. It enables the quiz creator to direct participants to different follow-up questions or content based on their responses to previous questions. This is particularly useful in creating quizzes that adapt to the user's input, offering a personalized path through the quiz.
    For instance, in a skincare consult quiz, you may start with a question about the participant's skin type (Dry, Normal, Combination, or Oily). Based on the answer, Jump Logic can direct the participant to questions specifically relevant to their skin type, thereby skipping irrelevant questions and tailoring the quiz experience.
!!! warning
    It is advised not to mix [Jump Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) and [Skip Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#skip-logic) in one quiz. Mixing logic rules can lead to unexpected results.

## Add Jump Logic to Questions
Jump Logic allows you to route customers to different questions based on their responses.
!!! info
    All the Jump Logic rules follow the same format:
    - **IF response to** pick the question from a dropdown list
    - **is**/ **is not** pick a choice from the dropdown list
    - **THEN go to:** pick a slide from the dropdown list or add a URL 
    1. Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/).
    2. **Open Jump Logic**: Navigate to the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab and select [`Jump Logic`](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) section.
    3.  **Add Jump Logic**: Click `Add Jump Logic` to add a new Jump Logic rule for the selected question. Here, you'll define your conditional statement using the template:
        - IF the response to `question X`
        - IS EQUAL TO `choice Y`
        - THEN go to `question Z`
        !!! example
            ![quiz builder conditional logic jump logic rule](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogicrule.png){width="500"}
            In the example, if a user chooses a choice "Myself" in Question 1 "Who are you shopping for?" then they will be redirected to Question 2 "What is your skin type?".
    4. **Multiple Conditions:** You can add more than one Jump Logic rule to a single question by clicking on the big `+` button in the bottom right corner. This allows for complex paths that can direct participants to various follow-up questions based on their specific answers.
        - **+** - Add another Jump Logic rule. Adds a new OR logical rule.
            !!! example
                ![quiz builder conditional logic jump logic OR rule](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogicrule_or.png)

## Examples and Applications
### Branching the Quiz
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HfYhbWB21Qg?si=K5rbKH2WhSmVBTeP" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    ![how to hide content with logic jump logic](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_jump_logic.png){width="500"}
    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add a `Multiple choice question` asking the customer about their skin type: Dry, Normal, Oily, or Combination-type skin. 
        !!! tip
            Use the description box in `Question Settings -> Show Description` to help customers determine their skin type.
    2. **Create Statement Questions**: Add multiple `Statement` slides describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:
        !!! example
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness – we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that’s deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn’t experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin’s natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
    3. **Add Jump Logic**: If we don’t add jump logic to the quiz, our statement questions will just appear one after the other, regardless of the choice we made. To add jump logic, you should go back to the skin type question and select [conditional logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/). Set up `IF-THEN` statements with `OR` logic to direct the customer to the correct text based on their skin type. 
        ![how to hide content with logic jump logic statement](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_jump_logic_statement.png)
    4. **Add "Always Jump to..." Logic**: Once all the statements are linked with logic to the skin type question, you should point each statement to the next question in the quiz. This is done by going to the [jump logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/) tab and scrolling toward the `Always jump to...` section. Point each statement to the next question.
    4. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.

### Jump Logic vs. Skip Logic
While Jump Logic and Skip Logic may seem similar, they serve distinct purposes. **Jump Logic** creates separate, divergent paths for participants based on their answers, effectively jumping to different questions or content. **Skip Logic**, on the other hand, determines if a question should be presented or skipped, maintaining a single path but customizing the questions seen by the participant. 
!!! warning
    It's not recommended to use both Jump Logic and Skip Logic on one quiz.
## Additional Resources
Understanding conditional logic, the foundation of Jump Logic, can be challenging. Resources such as [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=A+AND+%28B+OR+C%29) and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/programming-101/boolean-logic/a/compound-booleans-with-logical-operators) offer tutorials on AND/OR logic, which can enhance your ability to create effective and complex quiz flows.

This article explains how to use Jump Logic in the quiz to send users to different follow-up questions, results pages or external URLs based on their answers.

    # H1
    ## H2
    ### H3
    ```

# How to Use Skip Logic

[Skip Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#skip-logic) is a tool used in quizzes or surveys to make answering questions smoother for people taking them. It works by changing the order of questions based on the answers given to previous questions. This means if someone answers a question a certain way, they might skip some questions or see different ones next. 

!!! info "Use Skip Logic to:"

    - Skip questions based on the user's answers.
    - Show different follow-up questions based on the user's answers to multiple-choice questions that allow multiple selections. For example, if you want to show different follow-up questions based on the (skin, health) concerns the user selects.


In this article, we will show you how to set up and use Skip Logic in your quiz, including specific use-cases and step-by-step instructions.

??? question "What's Skip Logic?"
    Skip Logic uses IF-AND statements to determine if a question should be skipped based on the user's answers.
!!! warning
    It is advised not to mix [Jump Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) and [Skip Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#skip-logic) in one quiz. Mixing logic rules can lead to unexpected results.

    - **IF response to** pick the question from a dropdown list
    - **is**/ **is not** pick a choice from the dropdown list
    - **THEN this question is skipped**
    1. You can introduce Skip Logic into your quiz by accessing the [Conditional Logic settings](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) of a question.
    2. Open the [Skip Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#skip-logic) tab. 
    3. **Add Skip Logic**: From here, click `Add Skip Logic`. You can create a new Skip Logic statement specifying the conditions under which the current question should be bypassed. These statements follow a simple format: IF the answer to `question X` IS EQUAL TO `choice Y`, THEN skip this question. 
        !!! example
            ![quiz builder conditional logic skip logic rule](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_skiplogicrule.png)
            In the example, if a user chooses a choice "A gift" in Question 1 "Who are you shopping for?" then Question 2 "What is your skin type?" will be skipped (it will not be shown).
    4. All slides that contain Skip Logic will be marked with `"skip logic"` text.
    5. Multiple Skip Logic rules can be added to any question if needed.
        - **+** - Adds another Skip Logic rule. Adds a new OR logical rule.
        - **bin** - Delete the current Skip Logic rule.
        - **+ add concurrent logic** - Adds a new AND logical statement to the same rule. AND conditional statements can be tricky, as both statements have to be true for the rule to take effect. For most quizzes, using the OR rule is enough.

## Examples and Applications
### Skip Questions Based on User's Answers
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHYDwwTIuWg?si=pRhc-juq4lgIsIw2" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    **Scenario**
    You want to provide personalized advice based on the customer's skin type. Imagine creating a quiz that determines a personalized skincare routine. *Question 4* might ask about the participant's skin type, and depending on the answer, a different statement or recommendation about their skincare is shown. This individualized response is made possible by Skip Logic, which then continues the quiz based on the participant's specific path.
    ![how to use skip logic example](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_skip_logic.png)
    **Implementation**
    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add a `Multiple choice question` asking the customer about their skin type: Dry, Normal, Oily, or Combination-type skin. 
        !!! tip
            Use the description box in `Question Settings -> Show Description` to help customers determine their skin type.
    2. **Create Statement Questions**: Add multiple `Statement` slides describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:
        !!! example
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness – we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that’s deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn’t experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin’s natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
    3. **Add Skip Logic**: If we don’t add skip logic to the quiz, our statement questions will just appear one after the other, regardless of the choice we made. To add [skip logic](/how-to-guides/use-skip-logic/), you should go back to the skin type question and select `conditional logic`. Next, you should navigate to the `Skip Logic` section and add a skip logic rule to each statement. Use skip logic to ensure that only relevant statement questions appear based on the customer's skin type selection.

### Show Different Follow-Up Questions After Multiple-Selection Question
    **Scenario**
    You want to create a beauty quiz where customers can select multiple areas of concern (nails, skin, hair, etc.) and then only see follow-up questions relevant to their selections.
    **Implementation**
    1. **Create a Multiple Selection Question**: Start with a question that allows customers to select multiple options, such as "Which areas would you like to focus on?" with choices like "Nails", "Skin", "Hair", and "Makeup".
        !!! tip
            You can allow multiple selections in the [block settings > multiple choice settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#multiple-choice).
    2. **Set Up Follow-up Questions**: Create a series of follow-up questions for each area, arranged in groups:
        - Questions 2-3: Nail-related questions
        - Questions 4-5: Skin-related questions
        - Questions 6-7: Hair-related questions
        - Questions 8-9: Makeup-related questions
    3. **Apply Skip Logic to Each Follow-up Question**:
        - For each nail-related question (2-3), add a Skip Logic rule: "IF response to Question 1 IS NOT 'Nails' THEN this question is skipped"
        - For each skin-related question (4-5), add a Skip Logic rule: "IF response to Question 1 IS NOT 'Skin' THEN this question is skipped"
        - For each hair-related question (6-7), add a Skip Logic rule: "IF response to Question 1 IS NOT 'Hair' THEN this question is skipped"
        - For each makeup-related question (8-9), add a Skip Logic rule: "IF response to Question 1 IS NOT 'Makeup' THEN this question is skipped"
        !!! example
            ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_skiplogic_example](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_skiplogic_example.png)
            In the example, if a user chooses a choice "Too shiny" in Question 9 "SKIN CONCERNS" then Question 10 "ALERGIES" will be skipped (it will not be shown).
    4. **Result**: When a customer selects multiple areas (e.g., "Nails" and "Skin"), they will only see the follow-up questions for those specific areas, skipping all others. This creates a personalized experience while maintaining a linear quiz structure.
    !!! tip
        This approach works best with a linear quiz structure (no branching). The key is to use the "IS NOT" condition in your Skip Logic rules, which ensures that questions are only shown when the customer has selected the relevant option in the main question.

    ![how to use skip logic example2](/images/how_to_use_skip_logic_example2.png)
    **Implementation**
    - Start with a `Yes/No question` asking if the customer is willing to leave their email.

### Skip Logic vs. Jump Logic
The new app interface gives the option to use Jump Logic and Skip Logic. You shouldn’t combine both types of logic in the same quiz.
- **Jump Logic** creates diverging paths within a quiz based on respondent answers, allowing for a branched experience.
- **Skip Logic**, in contrast, customizes the path by omitting certain questions based on previous answers, keeping the overall sequence intact but personalized.
## Additional Resources
Understanding conditional logic, the foundation of Skip Logic, can be challenging. Resources such as [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=A+AND+%28B+OR+C%29) and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/programming-101/boolean-logic/a/compound-booleans-with-logical-operators) offer tutorials on AND/OR logic, which can enhance your ability to create effective and complex quiz flows.
---
This guide explains how to use Skip Logic in your quiz to hide follow-up questions based on the user's answers and includes specific use-cases and step-by-step instructions.

## How to change my billing details?
    Payments are handled by Stripe, the payment processor. Since we don’t store credit card details and we don’t have access to them, the process to change it in Stripe would be the following:
    1. You can access all your Stripe billing details via [this link](https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/aEUcNW6ex8cZgy4aEE).
    2. You’ll be required to log in with your email and a 2-Factor Authentication code that will be sent to your inbox:
        ![manual_woo_plans_pricing_change billing details login](/images/manual_woo_plans_pricing_change_billing_details.png)
        !!! note
            The login is the email that you used when you first provided your credit card details.
    3. Once you log in, you’ll see a screen similar to this one:
        ![manual_woo_plans_pricing_change billing details stripe](/images/manual_woo_plans_pricing_change_billing_details_stripe.png)
    4. There you can edit the invoices and credit card details, download the invoices, cancel the subscription, etc.
        !!! tip
            To add your VAT number on the invoice provide it as a first line of your name or address, for example, JOHN DOE VAT XXXX or VAT XXXX JOHN DOE. Stripe does not have a dedicated field for the VAT number.
    or alternatively:
    1. Access the plugin and navigate to the Plans & Pricing screen
    2. Click on the “GET FREE” button to downgrade to the Free Plan. This will cancel your Stripe subscription.
    3. Upgrade again to the Basic Plan, this time introducing your new credit card details.
    4. We’ll proceed to issue a refund for the days not used in your previous Basic Plan billing cycle.
    If you can’t downgrade to the Free Plan because you’re above your usage limit, please [contact support](/how-to-guides/contact-customer-support/).

    Jump Logic allows you to route customers to different questions based on their responses.
    `Add Jump Logic` - Click to add a new Jump Logic rule for the selected question.
    !!! info
        All the Jump Logic rules follow the same format
        - **IF response to** pick the question from a dropdown list
        - **is**/ **is not** pick a choice from the dropdown list
        - **THEN go to:** pick a slide from the dropdown list or add a URL 
    !!! example
        ![quiz builder conditional logic jump logic rule](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogicrule.png){width="500"}
        ![quiz builder conditional logic jump logic rule go to](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogicrule_goto.png){width="500"}
        In the example, if a user chooses a choice "Myself" in Question 1 "Who are you shopping for?" then they will be redirected to Question 2 "What is your skin type?".
    `+` - Add another Jump Logic rule. Adds a new OR logical rule.
    !!! example
        ![quiz builder conditional logic jump logic OR rule](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogicrule_or.png)
        In the example, if a user chooses a choice "Myself" in Question 1 "Who are you shopping for?" then they will be redirected to Question 2 "What is your skin type?" but if the user chooses a choice "A gift" in Question 1 "Who are you shopping for?" then they will be redirected to Question 4 "What is their skin type?".
    `bin` - Delete the current Jump Logic rule.
    `+ add concurrent logic` - Adds a new AND logical statement to the same rule. AND conditional statements can be tricky, as both statements have to be true for the rule to take effect. For most quizzes, using the OR rule is enough.
    !!! example
        ![quiz builder conditional logic jump logic AND rule](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogicrule_and.png){width="500"}
        In the example, **only if** a user chooses a choice "Myself" in Question 1 "Who are you shopping for?" **and** a choice "Dry" in Question 2 "What is your skin type?" they will be redirected to Question 3 "What's your age?".
    `Always jump to:` - Select a slide or URL where the user will be always redirected after this slide.

### Drop-off
    ![manual_woo_quizbuilder_metrics_dropoff](/images/manual_woo_quizbuilder_metrics_dropoff.png)
    The drop-off rate is measured based on events, which are triggered whenever someone starts a quiz. Some of these start events can be blocked by adblocking plugins in browsers. If you see a difference between the number of quiz starts and the dropoff rate, that is because the number of quiz starts in the analytics tab is automatically adjusted by the algorithm to filter in also the starts blocked by the ad blocker plugin.
    ![quiz builder metrics drop off dates](/images/manual_quizbuilder_metrics_dropoff_dates.png)

## Intro 
    In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to use simple [conditional logic](/how-to-guides/use-conditional-logic/) to give personalized advice. 
    A quiz can act as a professional shopping assistant. It can react to the answers given by the customer and provide valuable feedback. All it takes is a bit of logic. 
    In this Skin Care Quiz, there are four blocks of text. Each describes in more detail what a skin type needs in terms of skincare.
    With RevenueHunt app, you can show customers with dry skin certain questions (specifically targeted for them), while customers with oily skin would skip these questions. This can be done in many ways within the app.
    **Objective**: In this video, we’ll teach you how to show these texts using [Jump Logic](#jump-logic), [Skip Logic](#skip-logic), or [Display Logic](#display-logic) on the results page.

## Jump Logic
    Let’s start with Jump Logic.
    1. To display text advice in the quiz, you’ll need a `Statement question`.
    2. Make it longer by adding a description.
    3. One statement will be needed for each type of skin advice.
    Now, how can we make only one block appear, instead of all of them, one after the other? We can use [Jump Logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/).
    1. Open the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab and select a question. 
    2. Let’s add the first [Jump logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) condition:
        - If the answer to `‘How does your skin feel on an average day?’` is `‘Dry and tight all over’` then *Dry skin* advice should appear. 
    3. Click on the `+` plus sign to add another statement that can be true. This creates an additional `OR` conditional statement.
        - If the answer to `‘How does your skin feel on an average day?’` is `‘Oily all over’` then *Oily skin* advice should appear. 
    4. The `OR` separator between conditions means that only one of these has to be true for the logic to work.
    5. Let’s add conditions for the *Combination* and *Normal* skin.
    6. To ensure the customer doesn’t see all four statements additional [Jump logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) should be added to each of them. 
    7. Click on a `statement` question.
    8. In the `Always jump to…` section, indicate the question or a page that should preceed it.
    9. Do the same for the other three statements.
    10. Now that all is set, let’s update the preview/live quiz with the top-right `Publish` button and test it with `Preview`.
        - First, select `Dry skin`. 
        - Now let’s go back and select `Oily skin`.
    It seems that everything works correctly, well done!
    You’ve successfully added Jump Logic to your quiz. Your customers will now be able to see this personalized advice whenever they take the quiz.
    !!! tip "Jump Logic - other use cases"
        [Jump Logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/) is a powerful tool. It can also be used to:
        - redirect the customer to another, external URL directly from the quiz,
        - create branching in the quiz to send the customer to different answering paths,
        - create branching to link different products to the same choices,
        - or send customers to different Result Pages.

    It seems that everything works correctly, well done!
    You’ve successfully added Jump Logic to your quiz. Your customers will now be able to see this personalized advice whenever they take the quiz.
    !!! tip "Jump Logic - other use cases"
        [Jump Logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/) is a powerful tool. It can also be used to:
        - redirect the customer to another, external URL directly from the quiz,
        - create branching in the quiz to send the customer to different answering paths,
        - create branching to link different products to the same choices,
        - or send customers to different Result Pages.
    Let’s start with Jump Logic.
    1. To display text advice in the quiz, you’ll need a `Statement question`.
    2. Make it longer by adding a description.
    3. One statement will be needed for each type of skin advice.
    Now, how can we make only one block appear, instead of all of them, one after the other? We can use [Jump Logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/).
    1. Open the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab and select a question. 
    2. Let’s add the first [Jump logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) condition:
        - If the answer to `‘How does your skin feel on an average day?’` is `‘Dry and tight all over’` then *Dry skin* advice should appear. 
    3. Click on the `+` plus sign to add another statement that can be true. This creates an additional `OR` conditional statement.
        - If the answer to `‘How does your skin feel on an average day?’` is `‘Oily all over’` then *Oily skin* advice should appear. 
    4. The `OR` separator between conditions means that only one of these has to be true for the logic to work.
    5. Let’s add conditions for the *Combination* and *Normal* skin.
    6. To ensure the customer doesn’t see all four statements additional [Jump logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) should be added to each of them. 
    7. Click on a `statement` question.
    8. In the `Always jump to…` section, indicate the question or a page that should preceed it.
    9. Do the same for the other three statements.
    10. Now that all is set, let’s update the preview/live quiz with the top-right `Publish` button and test it with `Preview`.
        - First, select `Dry skin`. 
        - Now let’s go back and select `Oily skin`.
    It seems that everything works correctly, well done!

## Skip Logic
    For linear quizzes, using [Skip Logic](/how-to-guides/use-skip-logic/) instead is recommended.
    To achieve the same effect you can set up your statements to be shown one after another.
    1. Navigate to the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab, select a question and open the [Skip Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#skip-logic) menu.
    2. Then, add a Skip Logic rule to each statement. For example, when selecting a *Dry skin* statement, the rule states:
        - If the answer question `‘How does your skin feel on an average day?’` **IS NOT**  `Dry and tight all over`, then this question is skipped.
        - This implies that the *Dry skin* statement will **NOT** be skipped only if the answer to that question is `Dry and thigh all over`. In all other cases, the statement will **NOT** be shown.
    3. Similar rules shall be applied to the statements about the *Oily*, *Combination*, and *Normal* skin.
    4. Once all is set up, make sure to publish the changes with the top-right `Publish` button.
    5. Let’s test the quiz with the `Preview` button.
    It worked! The correct statement is shown and all the others are skipped based on the skin type the customer selected in the previous question.
    !!! tip "Skip Logic - other use cases"
        [Skip logic](/how-to-guides/use-skip-logic/) can also be used to:
        - show or hide a number of follow-up questions,
        - show or hide follow-up content based on questions that allow multiple answers.

## Display Logic
    Logic can also be applied to the contents of your [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/). 
    With [Display logic](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/), you can show or hide elements of your results page based on the customer's answers.
    1. Let’s add four `Content blocks` with the skin type advice to your [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/).
    2. You can edit the block text with [Markdown language](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/).
    3. Now, how can we make only one block appear, instead of all of them? We can add [Display logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#display-logic).
    4. To do that, activate it in the lower right corner with the `...` button. 
    5. Let’s add the first logic condition.
        - If the answer to `‘How does your skin feel on an average day?’` is `‘Dry and tight all over’` then this block (*Dry skin block*) will be **Visible**. 
        - In all other cases, it will be **Hidden**. 
    6. Now, let’s add similar rules to other content blocks.
    7. Let’s publish the changes with the top-right `Publish` button and test the quiz again with `Preview`.
    You’ve now successfully used Display logic to show and hide content on the Results page.
    !!! tip "Display Logic - other use cases"
        [Display Logic](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/) is a powerful tool that can also be used to:

    Product Recommendation Quiz works like a voting system:
    - Products are linked to each choice. 
    - When a customer picks that choice, all linked products receive one vote.
    - After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the products sorted by the number of votes.

## Intro
So you're ready to create your first Product Recommendation Quiz. 
The most successful quizzes have two things in common. They are **short** and they are **informative**. You don't need a long questionnaire to turn visitors into customers. 
**Objective**: Let's say that you run a cosmetics shop and have a selection of cleansers for different types of skin. Let's build a short quiz to help your customer choose the best cleanser for them.
## Add a New Quiz
    1. Let's add a new quiz from your [dashboard](/reference/dashboard/).
    2. [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) is where you'll create your quiz. 
    3. Click on the `+` plus sign and choose a question type. 
    4. You can edit the question and you'll see how it looks in the preview.
    5. To change [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings), click on :material-wrench:, a little wrench icon. Here, you can change things like adding a question description or an image.
    6. To make the quiz more personal you can add a `Name question` and recall the answer in other parts of the quiz using [information recalls (@)](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/).
    7. To select the best cleanser, you may want to know the client's age, skin type and the environment they live in. `Multiple-choice questions` may be the best way to find out this information. Let's ask about a skin type. 
    8. Finally, we should find out the environment they live in. To make the quiz more interesting, we'll use a `Picture question` here. 
    9. Don't forget to add an `email question`! That's how you'll collect valuable leads for your marketing campaigns. In the [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings) you can make this one optional.
    10. Once you have all your questions you can move them around by drag and drop. 
    11. Make sure to keep the quiz short. Customers typically drop out after question 8 and almost nobody gets to question 12. There's power in simplicity!

## Linking Products
Once you're happy with the design, you can add products to each question. It is a very important step! 
    1. Our [success checklist](/reference/dashboard/#success-checklist) will remind you if there are no products associated with the answers.
    2. To add a product, go to the [Link Products](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) tab and click on the blank space after the answer.

        - When a customer picks that choice, all linked products receive one vote.
        - After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the products sorted by the number of votes.
        - If there is a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the products.
    6. Make sure to link products to each question and choice in the quiz.

        `#quiz p {color: red;}` - Changes the color of all paragraphs in the quiz.
        `#question-AbC7Zde p {color: red;}` - Changes the color of a paragraph only in question AbC7Zde.
        You can find the `question ID` in [Quiz Builder > Question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).
    You can style any element of your quiz or results page using the built-in CSS console in the Quiz Design tab.
    - Open your quiz and go to the [Quiz Design](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/) tab.
    - In the Custom CSS section, click `Add` to open the CSS console. This will create an input area where you or your developer can add rules that override the default quiz styles.
    - To find the correct selector, right-click on the element in your browser and choose `Inspect`. Copy the selector from the developer tools.

## Questions Tab
    In the [Quiz Buider](/reference/quiz-builder/) tab, you can design each question/slide. 
    **Question Settings**
    Click on the `wrench icon` in the bottom-right corner to open the [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).

        !!! info "Show description"
            ![tutorial_legacy_question_description_example](/images/tutorial_legacy_question_description_example.png)
            Description fields are very useful as they not only allow you to add extra text to the slide but also style it using the [Markdown](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/) language, embed images and videos using [Markdown](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/) or use [information recalls](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) to display the user's previous answers.
    - **Image** - Click `Add` to uplaod a featured image to the question. Image should be max 1000px x 1000px. An extra menu appears once activated. You can choose the image position and adjust the opacity.

    - **Video** - Click `Add` to uplaod a featured video to the question. An extra menu appears once activated. You can choose the video position and adjust the opacity.
    - **Join next question**- Allows you to join the current question with the next one.

    - **Custom JS Code** - Click `Add` to open a JavaScript console. Allows you to add custom JavaScript to the quiz question.
        !!! tip "Custom JavaScript"
            You can add custom JavaScript to **questions** and the [**results page**](#results-page-tab) to extend behavior and layout.
            **Use cases**
            - Inject custom texts, images, and conditional UI.
            - Adjust layout dynamically.
            - Render custom product recommendations.
            - Redirect to a specific store page.
            - Fire tracking on specific steps (GA, Meta Pixel, etc.).
            See [How to Add JavaScript to the Quiz](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) for implementation details and best practices.
    **Adding Media**
    You can add media into quiz questions in two ways:
    1. **Per-question media** via [**Question Settings**](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings): Upload a unique image per slide (background or split) or add a short **video** block for richer context.

## Sending Emails to Respondents
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/59f5f73b491545fe85b6a3aaeb025bf1?sid=e7fd0e9f-c795-460b-969b-5b94226c0876" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    1. **Add Your SMTP Credentials**: Go to [`App Settings > SMTP`](/reference/app-settings/#smtp) and provide your email SMTP credentials. Follow [these instruction](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails-from-custom-server/) to learn how to set this up.
        ![manual_appsettings_smtp](/images/manual_appsettings_smtp.png)
        !!! note
            SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. SMTP is a connection protocol that enables third-party apps (e.g. RevenueHunt) to send emails through your email server.
            When you connect the RevenueHunt app to your SMTP Server, the follow-up emails with the quiz results that are sent to your customers will be sent from your email account.
            <b>If you're unsure what credentials to use, check your email provider's documentation (look for "SMTP") or contact their customer support.</b>
    1. **Add Email Question**: Before you set up your result emails, you need to make sure that the quiz has an email question. To add an email question go to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/).
    2. **Activate Respondent Emails**: Go to [`Notifications > TO RESPONDENT`](/reference/quiz-builder/notifications/#to-respondent) and toggle the `Send email when someone completes the quiz` button to activate the emails.
        ![how to activate to respondent emails](/images/manual_quizbuilder_notifications_torespondent_active.png)
    3. **Edit REPLY-TO**: Choose what email the customers will be able to reply to once they recieve the results.
    4. **Email TO**: If you have more than one email question in your quiz, choose an answer to which email question should be used to send the result emails. If you have only one email question, it will be selected by default.
    5. **Email Subject**: Edit the title of the email that customers will receive. You can use `@` to [recall information](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) such as the customer name or the quiz name in the title field.
    5. **Edit Email Content**: Configure the email your customers will receive. You can choose between a **Basic (text)** email format or **Advanced (HTML)** email format. You can switch between the two by clicking `switch to advanced HTML message` or `switch to basic text message` in the `Email Text Message` field.
        - **Basic text** email template is easy to use. Type the text that you want the customer to see in the `Email Text Message` field. You can personalize the email subject and content. You can add dynamic elements with `@`. Use `@` / [Information Recalls](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) to recall quiz information in the email body. You can recall data such as customer name, email, phone number, quiz name, question responses, recommended products and more. Basic email template does not allow the display of images or color customization but offers maximum deliverability.
        ![how to send result emails basic tempalte](/images/manual_quizbuilder_notifications_torespondent_active_basic.png)
        - **Advanced HTML** email template requires the knowledge of HTML and [Handlebars helpers](https://github.com/helpers/handlebars-helpers) to be edited. Incorporate quiz response metadata like `{{first_name}}` to personalize emails. You can use Handlebars to loop through and display recommended products or customize content based on quiz outcomes. Note that HTML emails are not rendered the same in different email clients and that you should add styles inline, not as classes. You also can’t add JavaScript code since it won’t be executed by email clients.

    5. **Edit Email Content**: Configure the email your customers will receive. You can choose between a **Basic (text)** email format or **Advanced (HTML)** email format. You can switch between the two by clicking `switch to advanced HTML message` or `switch to basic text message` in the `Email Text Message` field.
        - **Basic text** email template is easy to use. Type the text that you want the customer to see in the `Email Text Message` field. You can personalize the email subject and content. You can add dynamic elements with `@`. Use `@` / [Information Recalls](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) to recall quiz information in the email body. You can recall data such as customer name, email, phone number, quiz name, question responses, recommended products and more. Basic email template does not allow the display of images or color customization but offers maximum deliverability.
        ![how to send result emails basic tempalte](/images/manual_quizbuilder_notifications_torespondent_active_basic.png)
        - **Advanced HTML** email template requires the knowledge of HTML and [Handlebars helpers](https://github.com/helpers/handlebars-helpers) to be edited. Incorporate quiz response metadata like `{{first_name}}` to personalize emails. You can use Handlebars to loop through and display recommended products or customize content based on quiz outcomes. Note that HTML emails are not rendered the same in different email clients and that you should add styles inline, not as classes. You also can’t add JavaScript code since it won’t be executed by email clients.

## Create Collections/Categories
    1. In the [Skincare Quiz Demo](https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/) shop, there are four types of skincare products: cleansers, toners, serums, and moisturizers. 
    2. For the slots to work correctly, you’ll have to **create four categories** and include all the corresponding products in them. For example:
        - a *Cleansers* category should have all the cleansing products, 
        - a *Toners* category should have all the toning products, 
        - a *Serums* category should have all the serums, etc.
    3. To create a category, check [this article](https://woocommerce.com/document/managing-product-taxonomies/#product-categories) for detailed instructions on managing categories in WooCommerce.

        - `Multiple-choice questions` can be useful in finding out the client’s age, skin type, skin concerns or the environment they live in.
        - Additionally, a skin sensitivity question will be added. In the [next section](#exclude-products) of this tutorial, you’ll learn how to [exclude products](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/#exclusion) containing allergens from your recommendations.

## Upvote Collections/Categories
    Once your quiz is built and styled, you should add products and categories to individual choices.
    1. To do that, go to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and open the [Link Collections/Categories](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/) tab. 
    2. For the age question, you can link the *youth* and *anti-aging* collections/categories created earlier.
    3. Then, let’s link the *skin type* collections/categories.
    4. You can link one or more collections/categories to the same choice.
    5. Continue like this and make sure that each choice in the quiz has products or collections/categories linked, otherwise you may end up with empty results.
    !!! info "Product recommendation algorithm"
        The product recommendation algorithm works like a [voting system](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/). 
        - Products are linked to each choice.
        - When a customer picks that choice all the linked products receive one vote.
        - This includes all the products inside the linked collection. 
        - At the end, the results page will show slots with products sorted by the number of votes.

## Exclude Products
    Remember the sensitivity question asked at the end of the quiz? To remove harmful products from the recommendations use the [`exclude products`](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/#exclusion) feature. 
    1. To exclude a product go to the [Link Products](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) tab and select a question. 
    2. Tap on the greyed `exclude products` text and a white bar will appear. 
    3. Simply add the products that contain an allergen.
    Now, when a customer says he’s sensitive to *aloe vera*, all the products that contain it will be excluded from the possible recommendations. 
    !!! warning
        ❗Be careful when using exclusions. Once a product has been excluded it won't show on the results page, even if it was upvoted in another question.

## Add Slots
    Now let’s add a space for products.
    1. As a skincare store, you’d like to recommend a routine composed of a cleanser, a toner, a serum, and a moisturizer.
    2. Use `+` to add a `Product Slots Block` and create four different slots for each of the products. 
    3. In [product slot settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) you can:
        - Edit the slot name, 
        - Add a description,
        - And select how many products should be recommended in each slot.
    4. Slots won’t work unless you `include collections/categories` to each of them. It’s how they know which products to choose.
        - Include the *Cleansers* collection/category in the Cleansers Slot
        - Include the *Toners* collection/category in the Toners Slot
        - Include the *Serums* collection/category in the Serum Slot, etc.
    5. Make sure that the products in these collections/categories are [linked to the answers](#link-collections) in the quiz. Otherwise, the slots will produce empty results.
    6. Follow the same steps to create a morning routine.
    Et voila! You’ve just created a dynamic result page for your beauty quiz!
