# Adapt Product Quizzes for Different Markets and Languages

When a shopper lands on your store, they instantly notice two things:  

*Does this feel made for me?* and *Can I trust it?*  

![adapt quizzes to markets image1](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Quizzes-for-markets.png)

If your quiz greets a French customer in English, shows dollars instead of euros, or asks questions that feel out of place in their culture, you lose that moment of connection.  

Adapting your quizzes for different markets and languages is not just a technical detail ‚Äî it‚Äôs a way of saying **you belong here**.

---

## The Case for Localization

Think of your quiz as a digital salesperson.  
A good salesperson doesn‚Äôt speak the same script to everyone ‚Äî they adapt depending on who‚Äôs in front of them.

- In Spain, friendliness and warmth can make people more comfortable sharing information.  
- In Germany, clarity and compliance cues (like showing ‚Äúper 100ml‚Äù pricing) reassure customers that your brand is professional.  

    !!! tip "Tip: Product Metafields"
    
        To show the ‚Äúgrundpreis‚Äù or `per 100ml` price for cosmetic products RevenueHunt app allows you to show these values by automatically [syncing the metafields/attributes](/how-to-guides/add-product-metafields/) of products from your store.

- In the US, speed and incentives (‚ÄúTake this 45-second quiz for 10% off‚Äù) tend to drive engagement.

The same quiz, copied and pasted across all markets, misses those nuances. A localized quiz, on the other hand, feels natural ‚Äî and customers reward that effort with higher engagement and stronger conversions.


!!! info "Shopify Markets Support"

    The `üíé Built for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app fully supports the Shopify Markets feature allowing you to assign quizzes to different markets and languages quickly and easily.

    Check our step by step tutorial on how to set up Shopify Markets and assign quizzes to different markets and languages with the RevenueHunt app: [Assign Quizzes to Shopify Markets and Languages](/tutorials/shopify-markets/).

## What Changes When You Localize

Localization isn‚Äôt just swapping languages. It touches multiple layers of the experience:

**Language and tone.** A casual ‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs find your skincare match‚Äù might resonate in the US, while a more polished tone may feel appropriate in Japan.  

**Visuals.** Even colors carry meaning. Red signals good fortune in China but can imply danger in Western markets.  

**Currency and pricing.** Showing euros to a German customer instead of USD removes an instant layer of friction.  

**Legal requirements.** Some regions enforce very specific rules ‚Äî like GDPR consent in Europe or advertising standards in Canada.  

Together, these details tell your customers: *we understand you, and we built this experience for you*.

---

## The Business Payoff

Brands that localize their quizzes consistently see three wins:

1. **More completed quizzes.** People stick with what feels familiar and relevant.  
2. **Higher conversions.** Clear pricing and tailored recommendations reduce hesitation.  
3. **Deeper customer loyalty.** When someone feels seen, they‚Äôre far more likely to come back.

And there‚Äôs a side benefit: you gather **better data**. Localized quizzes reveal what customers in France care about versus what drives decisions in Australia. That‚Äôs market research you can act on.

---

## Tips for a Smooth Rollout

!!! tip "Check our tutorial"

    If you want the technical ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù on assigning quizzes to Shopify Markets, we‚Äôve got you covered here:  
    üëâ [Tutorial: Assign Quizzes to Shopify Markets and Languages](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/tutorials/shopify-markets/)

Start small. Choose your top two or three markets, duplicate your best-performing quiz, and adapt it. Don‚Äôt try to cover the globe in one sprint.  

Keep branding consistent. Customers should recognize your brand instantly, even if the tone shifts slightly to match local expectations.  

Test in the wild. The in-app preview won‚Äôt show market differences, so you‚Äôll need to publish and actually change your store region or language to see what customers see.  

Plan for upkeep. Quizzes aren‚Äôt ‚Äúset and forget.‚Äù Product lines evolve, translations need polishing, and regulations shift. Build localization into your ongoing operations, not as a one-off project.

---

A localized quiz does more than recommend products. It builds trust across borders, increases conversions, and turns your store into a brand that feels truly global.  

But remember: the real success lies not in the setup, but in the mindset.   Localization is the difference between saying *we sell everywhere* and *we care everywhere*.

# Smart Ways to Ask for Marketing/Data Processing Consent in the Quiz

Marketing and data processing is crucial for building trust and ensuring compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA. For ecommerce platforms, especially those in the beauty sector, product recommendation quizzes offer a unique and engaging way to collect valuable customer data. However, asking for consent must be done thoughtfully to avoid deterring users.

Here are smart, user-friendly strategies to ask for marketing and data processing consent in your RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz.

## First Consider **When** to Ask
The best way to ask for email/phone marketing consent is to make it a natural part of the quiz flow. Instead of presenting it as a standalone request, weave it into the narrative of the quiz. There are two approaches on when to ask for marketing consent and both will affect your quizzes drop-off rate/ completion rate:

### üëã Before the Quiz Begins

Start with a friendly welcome message that explains the benefits of taking the quiz. Mention that by providing consent, users will receive personalized recommendations and exclusive offers.

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent before the quiz begins](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent-start-quiz-1024x732.png)


Asking for consent before the quiz starts will lead to **lower quiz completions** and higher drop off at the beginning but will provide **more quality leads** and filter clients genuenly interested in your products. This approach is better for merchants selling unique and luxury items.

### üñêÔ∏è At the End

At a strategic point, such as before showing the results, include a consent request. Make it part of a question about communication preferences. This creates a sunk-time-cost fallaciy in the mind of the customer and they are more likely to leave their data just to see the results.

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent at the end](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent-end-quiz-e1718952561212-1024x702.png)

Asking for consent at the end of the quiz will lead to a **lower drop-off** at this point since the customer is already invested in the experience. This will lead to higher completion rates and eventually **higher conversions** and upselling success. This approach is better for merchants selling inexpensive items or routines.

It is not recommended to ask for email or marketing data mid-way through the quiz as this only increases your quiz drop-off rate.

## Next, if it should be **Optional** or **Mandatory**

Whether you make your email/phone number question mandatory or optional will also have a huge impact on your quiz drop-off and conversion rate.

### ‚õî Mandatory

Making the email/phone consent question mandatory ensures that you collect contact information from every user who completes the quiz. This can be beneficial for building a robust email list quickly. However, it may also deter some users from completing the quiz if they are not comfortable sharing their information.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Ensures a high volume of data collection | May increase quiz drop-off rates. May include many fake emails. |
| Filters out less engaged users, potentially leading to higher-quality leads | Some users may find it intrusive and opt-out early |


### ‚úÖ Optional

Making the email/phone consent question optional can create a more user-friendly experience, encouraging more users to complete the quiz. This approach respects user privacy and autonomy, potentially leading to higher overall quiz engagement.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Higher quiz completion rates | Lower volume of data collection |
| Users feel less pressured, leading to a more positive brand experience | May require additional incentives to encourage users to opt-in |

!!! tip "Tip: Make Question Optional"

    In RevenueHunt app you can choose if a quiz question should be mandatory or optional in [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).


## Then **How** to Ask for Marketing Consent

Clear and honest communication is key to gaining trust when asking for marketing consent. Here‚Äôs how to do it effectively:

###1Ô∏è‚É£ Use Transparent Wording

**Simplify your message** to avoid legal jargon and make it easy to understand. **Highlight the benefits** users gain by consenting, such as exclusive content, discounts, or early access to new products. Usually, Yes/No questions are straightforward and reduce friction in the consent process. Ask direct yes/no questions regarding consent to make it easy for users to make a choice..

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent friendly and transparent wording](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent-simple-language1.png)

!!! tip "Tip: Use a GDPR/Question"
    Use a GDPR/Yes-No Question type to easily ask for consent in RevenueHunt app.

**Example**: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd love to stay in touch to share the best skincare tips and product updates. Do we have your permission to send you emails?‚Äù or ‚ÄúGet the most out of our recommendations! Sign up for our newsletter to receive special offers and expert skincare advice.‚Äù or ‚ÄúDo you agree to receive our personalized product recommendations and updates? [ ] Yes [ ] No‚Äù.


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Add Link to Privacy Policy

Make your Privacy Policy easily accessible to add transparency and reassure users about how their data will be handled.
 
![smart ways to ask for marketing consent add a link to your privacy policy](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-14-122634-1536x621.png)

**Example**: ‚ÄúBy providing your email address you agree to our [privacy policy](https://www.linktoyourprivacypolicy.com).‚Äù
    
!!! tip "Tip: Link from any text element"
    You can link to your Privacy Policy within any text element of the RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz.


!!! tip "Tip: Marketing Checkmark"
    Follow [these instructions](/how-to-guides/ask-for-marketing-consent/#option-2-marketing-checkmark) to add a marketing checkmark to any quiz slide.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Design Choices Matter

The design and placement of consent requests can significantly impact user engagement.

**Use visual cues** like checkboxes or toggle switches for consent options. You can also use **clickable icons** instead of checkboxes or use buttons that change color or animate when clicked.

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent design choices matter](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent1.gif)

Ensure these options are accessible on all devices with large clickable areas for mobile users. Position consent requests at engaging points in the quiz to avoid disrupting the flow.

!!! tip "Tip: Use Picture Questions"
    Use [Picture Questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-types) to add animated gifs to your quiz choices in RevenueHunt app.

**Example**: ‚ÄúWant to receive our updates? Click the heart to say yes! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù or ‚ÄúWould you like to receive our updates? [ ] Yes, absolutely! (Enthusiastic yes gif) [ ] No, thanks. (Button shakes slightly)‚Äù.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Offer a Clear Opt-Out Option

Respecting user choice is essential. Always provide a clear and **easy way for users to opt-out of marketing communications. Reassure users they can still complete the quiz and receive recommendations even if they choose not to opt-in.

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent offer a clear opt-out option](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent-opt-out-hearts.png)

!!! tip "Tip: Question Description"
    You can add additional information to each quiz slide by activating a [question description](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings) or adding an extra text block in RevenueHunt app.

**Example**: ‚ÄúYou can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in our emails. You can still get your personalized recommendations without signing up for our newsletter.‚Äù

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Reward System

Offer immediate rewards or incentives for giving consent, such as a **discount code** or a free sample.

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent reward system](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent-discount3.png)


!!! tip "Tip: Add Discount"
    Check [this guide](/how-to-guides/add-discount/) to learn how to offer discounts in your RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz.

**Example**: ‚ÄúGet 10% off your next purchase! Do you agree to receive our exclusive offers? [ ] Yes, I love discounts! [ ] No, I‚Äôm good for now.‚Äù

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Build Trust with Transparency

Being transparent about how you will use the data builds trust and increases the likelihood of obtaining consent. Briefly explain why you need the data and how it will benefit the user. Reassure users that **their data will be handled securely** and respectfully.

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent build trust with transparency](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent-discount.png)

**Example**: ‚ÄúWe use your data to provide personalized skincare recommendations and to keep you updated with the latest offers. We respect your privacy and will never share your data with third parties.‚Äù

---

Obtaining consent for marketing and data processing in product recommendation quizzes doesn‚Äôt have to be a daunting task. By integrating consent requests into the quiz, using friendly and transparent wording, making smart design choices, offering clear opt-out options, and building trust through transparency, you can improve the user experience while ensuring compliance and building a strong relationship with your customers.

# How to build a Sales Funnel

*(that will convert customers on autopilot)*

The key to any successful eCommerce business is a healthy sales funnel. This is especially true for stores whose survival relies on transforming their site visitors from casual browsers into committed customers.

Over the past few years, eCommerce sales funnels have emerged as one of the fastest ways to get more sales, increase `Average Order Value` and sell more products to every visitor.

![sales funnel](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shopify-sales-funnel-simplified.png)

You‚Äôve probably seen the above visual representation of an eCommerce sales funnel a thousand times. Marketers use them all the time. As you get closer to a sale, the number of people that go to the next step decreases.

!!! info "Main advantages of having a sales funnel are:"

    ‚Äì **Increased sales through better targeting**. Sales funnels advise customers on finding the right products for them and help them make confident purchasing decisions.

    ‚Äì **Getting to know your customers**. During different steps of the funnel, you‚Äôll have the chance to collect actionable data about your customers and define your buyer personas, while considering demographics, customer motivation, behavior patterns, and goals. This information will help you when retargeting customers with segmented marketing campaigns.

    ‚Äì **Building long term relationships with your audience**. Only 2% of shoppers typically convert on their first visit to an eCommerce store. However, with the right incentives, it‚Äôs easy to capture new visitors‚Äô emails. This way you can start building a relationship with them and you can close more sales further down the road.

The process of creating a sales funnel has come a long way, too. Building a sales funnel used to take weeks, require tons of custom coding, and a whole team of developers. These days, **thanks to a few apps**, it‚Äôs now possible to have it **up and running in a few hours**.

A well-built sales funnel can be a powerful foundation to build your eCommerce business on. Unfortunately, the out-of-the-box solution doesn‚Äôt come with many common sales funnel features, like conversion quizzes, one-click upsells, order bumps, and even custom sales pages. However, there are many upsell apps available that help to boost conversion rate and increase revenue with different selling strategies.

!!! note "RevenueHunt"

    [RevenueHunt](https://revenuehunt.com) specializes in building sales funnels for established eCommerce businesses. As a Shopify Partner we focus on working specifically with Shopify stores. We‚Äôre specialists in creating funnels designed both to grow your email list and to drive your sales.

In this article I‚Äôm going to show you how to build a sales funnel that works seamlessly on Shopify to boost conversions for your eCommerce store. I‚Äôll show you exactly which apps to use, how to connect them and I‚Äôll share tips to make sure your funnel pages convert.


## What's an eCommerce Sales Funnel?

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty details of how to build a sales funnel for your eCommerce store, let‚Äôs get on the same page of exactly what a sales funnel is.

A sales funnel takes someone from being a visitor (someone who might have just found your brand through Social Media) and moves them through the buyer‚Äôs journey to become a customer. **It‚Äôs conformed by a number of steps designed to guide shoppers toward a buying decision**.** These steps include marketing assets that actually do the selling for you (eg. quizzes, emails and landing pages).

!!! tip "No sales funnel, no sales"

    Not having a sales funnel and driving paid traffic to your store is like approaching a complete stranger in the street and pitching them a $149 product. No way! 

Now, imagine entering a store and finding a friendly expert staff member who welcomes you and **helps you find exactly what you‚Äôre looking for**. Not only that, but they also share current promotions and sales, discuss complementary items and walk you through the checkout process.

That‚Äôs the effect a well-constructed sales funnel can have on your eCommerce store: **recreating the ‚Äúpersonal shopper‚Äù experience** for your online customers. The goal is to seamlessly guide customers through the entire buying process, from the moment they find out about your brand to buying your products.

!!! example "The Shopify Sales Funnel Template"

    ![sales funnel template](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shopify-sales-funnel-diagram.png)

    The above diagram is a summary of the blueprint we use to build sales funnels for our Shopify clients. We‚Äôll analyze each step in the funnel and I‚Äôll show you which apps to use in each step.


## Step 1: Turn visitors into Subscribers 

*(with a Conversion Quiz)*

Our main goal in this step is to **get your visitors‚Äô email before we send them to our first sales funnel**. It‚Äôs of great importance to get this first step right because the effectiveness of the rest of the steps will depend on it.

The easiest way to do this is with a conversion quiz created with the RevenueHunt app.

Not only will you offer your customers a personalized product recommendation, you‚Äôll also be able to **segment your customers based on their responses to the quiz**. It‚Äôs growing your email list on steroids. Apart from their contact details you‚Äôll gather important actionable data about your customers‚Äô preferences which you can use for higher ROI retargeting campaigns further down the funnel.

A product recommendation quiz is a fun way to engage your customers by offering them the chance to learn something about themselves. For example, if you‚Äôre selling coffee, a quiz can help your customers discover their ‚Äúcoffee personality‚Äù while they learn new facts about different types of coffee and **recommending products that are tailored to their preferences**.

Just **make sure you get their email**! You can do this by offering them an ethical bribe at the end of the quiz like ‚Äúget your results directly in your inbox and receive a 10% discount coupon for your next purchase‚Äù.

With Product Recommendation Quiz, you can use one of the pre-defined quiz templates and modify it (highly recommended) or create a new quiz from scratch.

## Step 2: Draw Subscribers Back to Your Funnel

Ideally, after taking the conversion quiz, your visitors will **proceed to your first Free+Shipping & Upsell funnel (Step 3)**. But this won‚Äôt always be the case.

You‚Äôll have to **draw visitors that dropped out back to your sales funnel**.

Remember that in the previous step we used a quiz to segment your customers? In this step you‚Äôll use that data to **send targeted drip email campaigns to segmented lists** that lead subscribers into sales funnels of free+shipping offers and higher-priced product upsells.

You‚Äôll use 2 tools for this: [Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/) and [Meta Pixel](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/).

### Klaviyo

First, [connect your quiz to Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/) to send captured leads to your email marketing list.

!!! info "Connect your quiz to Klaviyo"

    Check this article to learn how to connect your quiz to Klaviyo: [How to Send Quiz Leads to Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/)

The typical **Klaviyo retargeting campaign** consists of a drip flow of 4 emails. The first email is sent immediately and includes the products that have been recommended during the quiz along with a discount code. It also includes a link to a particular Free+Shipping & Upsells funnel. The rest of the emails deliver content which is targeted to that particular client and also link to the same funnel.

**The first email usually brings in 45% of the sales**, the second accounts for 30%, the third accounts for 15% and the fourth usually leads to the final 10% of revenue. These stats show that the first email in any drip campaign is always the most important in terms of engagement. It also highlights the importance of having a drip sequence which follows up.

It is of great importance to create dynamic segments based on your customers‚Äô responses and send each segment different, hyper-targeted campaigns (which return more than [3X the revenue per recipient](https://www.klaviyo.com/marketing-resources/segmentation-benchmark-report) as unsegmented campaigns ‚Äì more on this later).

With Klaviyo you can [create segments](/how-to-guides/create-segments-in-klaviyo/) to filter your leads and assign email flows to each segment.

### Meta Pixel

A complementary tool we‚Äôll use is the [Meta Pixel](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/). It‚Äôs an analytics tool that allows you to measure the effectiveness of your advertising by understanding the actions people take on your quiz.

It collects data that helps you track conversions from Facebook ads, optimize ads, build targeted audiences for future ads (lookalike audiences), and remarket to people who have already taken some kind of action on your website (retargeting).

!!! info "Set up a Meta Pixel"

    If you don‚Äôt have one already, follow [these instructions](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/#setting-up-your-meta-pixel) to create a new Pixel on Facebook and connect it to your quiz. 


In our case, we‚Äôll **use the Pixel to create 2 audiences**: 

1. People who have visited the website but still haven‚Äôt taken the conversion quiz
2. People who have taken the conversion quiz

!!! tip

    Check Meta documentation to learn how to create audiences: [How to Create Audiences with Meta Pixel](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/164749007013531?id=401668390442328)

Now we‚Äôll create 2 ads campaigns (on Facebook, Instagram or both, depending on your sector). We‚Äôll use them to **drive the first audience to the conversion quiz** (to capture their emails) and the **second audience to our Free+Shipping & Upsells funnels**.

We‚Äôll have several Free+Shipping & Upsells funnels in place, one for each customer type in order to maximize our ROI with hyper-segmentation.

!!! example "Hair care business"

    Let‚Äôs say you sell hair care products. You could use the conversion quiz to segment your customers into four categories:

    - Customers with straight hair
    - Customers with wavy hair
    - Customers with curly hair
    - Customers with coily hair

    Then you would create **4 different Free+Shipping & Upsells funnels**, one for each category, and different email drip campaigns drawing customers back to each of the funnels.


## Step 3: Create a Free+Shipping & Upsells funnel

The goals of this funnel are two:

- To separate lookie-loos (no intention of buying) from shoppers
- To make shoppers take action and start buying

We do this with a Free+Shipping offer: **people are inherently attracted to getting stuff for free**, even if they have to pay for the shipping to get it. Now once they‚Äôve pulled out their card and are willing to pay for something (even if it‚Äôs only the shipping costs) they‚Äôve already taken the first step and it‚Äôs much easier to pitch them upsells.

We show customers **one-time offers where they can get higher price items at discounted rates‚Ä¶ but only if they act NOW**. If they accept the offer, you don‚Äôt stop there. You pitch them another upsell. Why stop at one if they‚Äôre on a shopping run? If they don‚Äôt accept any of your upsells, you show them a downsell (a lower price product).

After your clients have gone through the upsells and downsells, they‚Äôre taken to the checkout page.

!!! example "Sample Funnel"

    Here‚Äôs an example of what a sales funnel would look like: [Skincare Quiz](https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/#quiz-wnHLkP)


I‚Äôm sure you can **find ideas of stuff you can give away for free**. Example: a cosmetics store can send free samples of creams and only charge for the shipping.

You can use the RevenueHunt app to create this funnel, just use one of our avialble quiz templates and adapt it to your store. This quiz‚Äôs logic is already pre-built to guide your customers through the different offers. You‚Äôll have to edit the texts, change the images and adjust the quiz‚Äôs design to match your store‚Äôs look & feel.


## Step 4: Optimize your Order Confirmation

Check out this sample Amazon thank you page:

!!! example "Amazon's thank you page"

    ![Amazon's thank you page](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/amazon-thank-you-page.png)

These guys know what they‚Äôre doing: they‚Äôre **cross-selling products even after the customer has completed the purchase**.

Your store‚Äôs order confirmation page (or ‚Äúthank you‚Äù page) gives you the perfect cross-sell opportunity. Also, customers visit the order status page more than once ‚Äì when receiving default notifications from your store (like shipping updates) via email or SMS.

By optimizing your thank you page and adding upsells or cross-sells, you will re-engage customers who just completed a purchase with your store and **catch them when they are most likely to buy**.

## Step 5: Convert Buyers into Repetitive Buyers

Here‚Äôs a metric you should be familiar with: `Repeat Customer Rate` (or `Repeat Purchase Rate`).

Repeat customer rate is the backbone of customer retention. It measures the percentage of customers **willing to make a second purchase from you**. Measuring your repeat purchase rate is an excellent way of evaluating how well your retention strategy is actually working. The higher this metric is, the more willing customers are to return to your store.

Fortunately, this is calculated for you in your [Shopify Analytics](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/reports-and-analytics/shopify-reports). If you want to do this manually, all you need to do is divide the number of customers with more than one purchase by the number of unique customers.

![repeat rate calculation](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/repeat-rate.png)

A repeat purchase is an indicator of a degree of customer loyalty to a brand. It is also an opportunity to establish long-term customer relationships. A high number of repeat purchases indicates a satisfied and ‚Äúwell-retained‚Äù customer. This reduces new-customer acquisition costs and increases overall profitability.

The big question is‚Ä¶ how can you increase this number?

The business‚Äô repeat purchase rate may be increased using promotions, loyalty programs and exceptional customer service. In summary: **following up with your customers**.

But with average open rates of email campaigns being at only 21.3%, you‚Äôll have to make sure you don‚Äôt end up in your customer‚Äôs spam folder. The solution to this is **sending the right message to the right customer at the right time** ‚Äì also known as hyper-segmentation.

[Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/) is an excellent tool for following up both via email and SMS. Combined with Product Recommendation Quiz it will take your follow-up campaigns to the next level. With Product Recommendation Quiz you‚Äôll be able to tag your customers based on their responses and you can create segments in Klaviyo based on these tags.

Unlike traditional subscriber lists, **segments are groupings of contacts defined by a set of conditions**. Lists are static, meaning they grow as people subscribe or are manually added. Segments, on the other hand, are dynamic. They grow as people meet the segments‚Äô conditions and shrink as people no longer meet them.

!!! example "How you can use segments to identify different audiences:"

    - Using a Product Recommendation Quiz to categorize customers based on their product preferences
    - Customers who purchase a new product, so you can watch the segment grow after launch
    - Inactive subscribers who have been on your list for at least 6 months but have never opened or clicked an email
    - Repeat customers, which includes everyone who has purchased at least X number of times before or have spent over Y amount of money


The bottom line here is that highly segmented campaigns return more than 3X the revenue per recipient as unsegmented campaigns thanks to higher open rates and click-through rates.


## Step 6: Turn Happy Customers into Brand Ambassadors

In today‚Äôs eCommerce industry, it‚Äôs not enough to offer the best products or the cheapest deals. Driving traffic to your Shopify store is only half the battle. If you don‚Äôt get your customers to buy, it‚Äôs wasted money in ads. So how do we persuade your visitors into buying?

There are multiple elements that are factored into a visitor‚Äôs motivation to take action and buy. We‚Äôre going to focus on one of the most important: **social proof**. 

Social proof is a **powerful psychological bias that causes us to copy others**. For example, when we are unsure what to do, we often imitate the people around us. People are persuaded more by the actions of others than by any argument we can give them.

Two ways to create social proof in your Shopify store are **customer reviews and user generated content**. Happy customers leave positive reviews, but here‚Äôs the catch: you‚Äôll have to ask them to leave one!

When asking for reviews, there are two factors you have to take into account:

- WHEN you ask
- HOW you ask


### WHEN to ask for reviews

In many cases, asking for a review request immediately after the purchase just doesn‚Äôt make sense. Normally, we say the ideal time to ask for a review is when you can be sure the buyer journey is over. The product will not only have arrived, but the customer will also have had a decent chance to use it.

This way, they can leave a review that‚Äôs really insightful and of high quality, covering everything from the on-site experience to delivery speed and quality of the item received.

We recommend sending a review request when the entire buyer journey has been completed ‚Äì this could be anywhere from 7 to 30 days depending on the product type and the delivery time.


### HOW to ask for reviews

Our experience is that the best way to do this is to first ask for feedback and later ask for a review. This way, you make sure that if there were any issues during the buyer journey you can address them before they leave a negative review.

Consider using a review app to automate the process of sending review requests. This takes away the stress of sending review requests, which would otherwise be a process you have to do manually. 

## Step 7: Measure, Analyze, Improve and Repeat

An important mistake many store owners make is to consider that the sales cycle ends when a purchase is completed. Nothing could be further from the truth. After a customer has bought a product there are still many cross-sell and upsell opportunities.

Getting existing customers to buy other products from you is much easier (and cheaper) than acquiring new customers. It‚Äôs much **more ROI efficient to maintain and grow an existing relationship** with a validated customer than starting from square one with a new visitor.

Additionally, we always recommend merchants to consider **collecting reviews and user-generated content from their customers as part of their sales cycle**. These reviews or ‚Äúcustomer success stories‚Äù can be used as social proof in other steps of the funnel and in your store.

It‚Äôs inevitable to experience some drop-off as customers move down the sales funnel. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to **measure conversion rates at each step**, so you can monitor and analyze these metrics and run A/B tests. You can use Google Analytics to monitor your funnel‚Äôs performance.

Every step of the funnel can be A/B tested and improved. 

!!! example "A few A/B tests that you can run are:"

    - Step 1: different CTAs to draw site traffic to your quiz
    - Step 2: different quiz lengths (benchmark: dropdown increases significantly past the 6th question)
    - Step 3: different ad copy
    - Step 4: different offers, upsells & downsells
    - Step 5: different confirmation page setups
    - Step 6: different email drips (email subject, content, frequency‚Ä¶)

Since you‚Äôll be measuring rates (percentage of customers that go from one step to the next) you can **run more than one A/B test at a time**.

---

eCommerce sales funnels are an easy and profitable upgrade for established stores with existing traffic. They can return the initial investment within just a few weeks.

Ecommerce stores should be using the power of sales funnels to turn cold traffic into subscribers and then into customers.

Sales funnels increase the average order value per visitor. This allows store owners to invest more on ads for their profitable funnels.

This article explains how to build a sales funnel for your eCommerce store.

# How to Convert Leads to Customers

A product recommendation quiz is more than just an engagement tool. Done right, it becomes the foundation of your **customer acquisition and retention strategy**. By capturing contact details and delivering personalized results, you can build trust, drive conversions, and turn first-time quiz takers into long-term buyers.

---

## Why Lead Conversion Matters

Every completed quiz gives you two things:

* **Zero-party data** ‚Äî insights customers willingly share (skin type, age, goals, preferences).
* **Buying intent** ‚Äî customers are already engaged and closer to purchase than cold leads.

Instead of letting this data sit idle, you should use it to **personalize follow-ups**. Sending the right product recommendations to the right person at the right time can dramatically increase sales.

---

## Send Result Emails Directly from the App

The simplest way to convert quiz takers is to **send results instantly**. With the üíéBuilt for Shopify RevenueHunt app, you can email quiz results without needing a third-party tool.

Why this works:

* Customers expect instant results after investing time in a quiz.
* Seeing personalized recommendations in their inbox builds credibility and encourages immediate action.
* You don‚Äôt need to set up external tools if you want a quick, lightweight funnel.

How to do it:

1. Add an **Email Address question block** to your quiz.
2. Go to **Quiz Settings ‚Üí Emails ‚Üí Respondents**.
3. Enable **Send Results Email** and customize the email template.
4. Personalize it with dynamic content such as product images, titles, and prices.

üëâ [Learn how to send result emails](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/)

---

## Connect Your Quiz to a CRM or Marketing Platform

For advanced flows, connect your quiz to your CRM or ESP (Email Service Provider). The app integrates with tools like **Klaviyo, Omnisend, Mailchimp, HubSpot, and Zapier**.

Why this matters:

* You can build **multi-step post-quiz email flows**.
* Quiz answers and recommended products are synced as custom properties in your CRM.
* You can segment your audience (e.g., ‚Äúdry skin + prefers vegan products‚Äù) and target them with tailored campaigns.

Best Practices for Follow-Up Email Flows

Sending results is just the first step. To maximize conversions, follow up with a structured email flow that builds trust and encourages repeat purchases.

Recommended flow for quiz-takers:

- **Results Email** (Immediately): Send the quiz results with recommended products and a clear ‚ÄúShop Now‚Äù CTA.

- **Education Email** (1‚Äì2 days later): Provide usage tips, routines, or benefits of the recommended products.

- **Social Proof Email** (3‚Äì5 days later): Share testimonials, before/after photos, or customer stories.

- **Incentive Email** (5‚Äì7 days later): Offer a discount, free gift, or bundle deal to drive the purchase.

- **Retention Email** (2‚Äì3 weeks later): Recommend refills, complementary products, or subscription options.

This sequence works especially well in the beauty and supplements industries, where customer trust and education play a big role in buying decisions.

Example flow in Klaviyo:

1. **Immediately** ‚Äì Send results with product images and ‚ÄúShop Now‚Äù CTA.
2. **1‚Äì2 days later** ‚Äì Send an educational email with tips for their skin/hair type.
3. **3‚Äì5 days later** ‚Äì Share testimonials or success stories.
4. **5‚Äì7 days later** ‚Äì Offer a discount code or bundle deal.
5. **2‚Äì3 weeks later** ‚Äì Retarget with refills or complementary products.

üëâ [See all integrations](/how-to-guides/integrations/)

---

## Other Tips for Converting Leads

* **Make the email optional**: Some customers prefer immediate results without sharing details. This keeps the experience frictionless while still capturing quality leads from engaged users.
* **Offer incentives**: Reward customers for completing the quiz with a discount or free gift. This boosts both lead capture and conversions.
* **Use personalization**: Address the customer by name and recall their quiz answers in follow-ups. This makes your messages feel like expert advice, not generic marketing.
* **Track performance**: Monitor open rates, click-through rates, and conversions in your ESP to refine your post-quiz funnel.

---

‚úÖ By combining instant result emails with a CRM-powered follow-up flow, you‚Äôll transform your quiz into a **conversion engine** that nurtures leads into loyal customers.

# How to Build a Successful Product Recommendation Quiz

Building a product selector for your eCommerce store has never been easier with our completely new `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app. 

!!! info "üíéBuilt for Shopify RevenueHunt app"

    The `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app is a new version of the app that went through a complete re-design.

    With our modern drag-and-drop builder, extensive design options, and powerful recommendation engine, you can create stunning quizzes that perfectly match your brand. We offer a variety of design and content [templates](https://revenuehunt.com/templates/) tailored specially for the beauty industry (skin care quiz, hair care quiz, lipstick match finder) and other verticals.

While creating a quiz is straightforward, ensuring it serves both your audience and your business requires some strategic thinking. At RevenueHunt, **we've analyzed countless successful product recommendation quizzes** and built our new Shopify app based on what works best. We've identified elements that make quizzes popular with online shoppers and drive results for brands.

In this article, we've gathered all this knowledge to help you build a high-converting product selector that uses the latest features of our platform.

<div class="videoWrapper">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJaiwjhyNgI?si=3XG85TzxvvXtsTw0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Here‚Äôs a list of things every Product Recommendation Quiz should have (and how to add them):

## 1. Make the quiz visible

*(publish on the header, publish in multiple locations)*

You can have the most beautiful and thought-through quiz in the world but it won't be useful if your customers cannot find it. Just like a real-life shop attendant, the quiz should reach out to the customers to ask *"Is there anything I can help you with?"*. 

Our new  `üíéBuilt for Shopify` RevenueHunt app offers native integration with your store, making it easier than ever to [publish your quiz](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz/). Unlike the legacy version that used iframes, the new version embeds directly into your store's theme for better performance and seamless integration. 

!!! info "You can:"

    - Add the quiz as a native Shopify block anywhere on your pages
    - Create a floating chat-like button that follows customers as they browse
    - Set up automatic popups for new visitors
    - Embed the quiz inline with your content
    - Add quiz links to your navigation menu

Most successful quizzes are **published in multiple locations** to help customers at different stages of their shopping journey. 

!!! example "You can publish your quiz in multiple locations:"

    - A native quiz block in your homepage header showcases the quiz as a key feature
    - A floating button provides easy access as customers browse your collections
    - An automatic popup engages first-time visitors
    - Inline quizzes within relevant collection pages help customers make informed choices (e.g., a shade finder quiz in your lipstick collection)

![how to build a succesful quiz image1](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image1.png)

Ensuring that the quiz is easy to find can make a big difference in your sales conversions. Most quiz takers try the quiz a few times before completing the purchase. Make the quiz visible and you‚Äôll see the sales go up!

## 2. Match the store‚Äôs design

*(Design: match stores font and color scheme, use a background image, CSS)*

You know this already. A beautifully designed website sells better than a generic one and so does the quiz! Our new  `üíéBuilt for Shopify` app takes quiz design to the next level with a powerful visual design system.

!!! info "Quiz Design Options"

    The new [Quiz Design](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/) interface features a Shopify-like Block Editor that makes customization intuitive and powerful:

    - **Visual Block Editor**: Add, reorder, and customize blocks for questions, results, product slots, and HTML content with simple drag-and-drop
    - **Typography & Colors**: Fine-tune your fonts, colors, and button styles to match your brand perfectly
    - **Modern Templates**: Choose from our collection of professionally designed templates built specifically for Shopify
    - **Layout Control**: Adjust spacing, alignment, and layout without touching code
    - **Custom CSS/JS**: For advanced users, you still have full control through custom code

The native integration with Shopify means your quiz will inherit some of your theme's styles automatically (like your website's font), creating a matching experience. You can then customize further to make it uniquely yours. Check out these beautiful [customization examples](https://revenuehunt.com/templates/#customization) to gather inspiration for your next quiz project!

![how to build a succesful quiz image2](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image2.png)

## 3. Come up with a professional name for the quiz

*(Eg. ‚ÄúShade Finder‚Äù, ‚ÄúPersonalized Skin Prescription‚Äù, ‚ÄúRoutine Builder‚Äù, ‚ÄúSkin Test‚Äù)*

Let‚Äôs talk names now. When you hear the word ‚Äòquiz‚Äô, what is the first thing that comes to mind? To most people a quiz is either a dreadful school memory or a lighthearted ‚ÄòWhich animal are you?‚Äô entertainment. The truth is, the word quiz doesn‚Äôt have the best reputation, but fortunately you don‚Äôt have to stick with it. 

Finding the right name for your quiz can sometimes be key to getting more conversions. A **‚ÄòShade finder‚Äô**, a **‚ÄòSkincare Routine builder‚Äô**, **‚ÄòSkin Diagnostic‚Äô**, **‚ÄòHair Analysis‚Äô** sound more like a professional questionnaire than entertainment, don‚Äôt they? The secret is in the name, so try to find something that fits your brand well and provides value for the customer. If you‚Äôre not sure what to choose, think about your customer‚Äôs most asked questions and start there.

![how to build a succesful quiz image3](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image3.jpg)

## 4. Add personalized advice

*(Jump logic, Skip logic, Display logic)*

One way to make the quiz more than just a product selector is to add personalized advice based on customer answers. Our new `üíéBuilt for Shopify` app makes this easier than ever with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for conditional logic.

!!! info "Conditional Logic"

    The new visual [Conditional Logic](/how-to-guides/hide-content-with-logic/) builder lets you create complex personalization flows without any coding:

    - Design complex branching paths with an intuitive interface similar to Shopify's theme editor with our visual logic builder
    - Chose from multiple logic types:

        - **Jump Logic**: Send customers to different questions based on their answers
        - **Skip Logic**: Hide irrelevant questions automatically
        - **Display Logic**: Show/hide content blocks based on previous answers
        - **Score Logic**: Track points and create personality-based recommendations


!!! example "When can I use logic?"

    - Does your customer have dry skin? Use Jump Logic to direct them to specific questions about dry skin concerns, completely skipping the oily skin path

    - Your customer suffers from hair loss? Create a branching path with Jump Logic that explores different causes (medication, genetic conditions, lifestyle) and provides tailored product recommendations and advice

    - Want to show special content to premium customers? Use Display Logic to reveal exclusive offers based on their responses

The visual logic builder makes it easy to create an experience that feels like talking to a real expert, guiding customers to the perfect products for their needs.

![how to build a succesful quiz image4](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic.png)

The same logic can also be applied to the contents of the Results Page. A different content block can be shown to customers with dry skin and oily skin. A different advice can be given to customers with colored or natural hair. 

![how to build a succesful quiz image4](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_answers_example1.png)

The Results Page is also a great place to give additional ‚Äúhow to use‚Äù advice or even add a prediction on how their skin will improve in the months/weeks of using the product (all depending on the customer's skin type).

## 5. Use descriptive pictures to help customers decide

*(Design your own icons & add picture questions)*

It is not always easy to know whether you have dry or oily skin, whether your complexion is light or dark, what exactly your hair-color is called‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs no better way to help the customer choose than by showing them an example. 

Adding a **[Picture question](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-types)** to your Product Recommendation Quiz can be a great way to help the customer pick the right answer and help them make an educated purchasing decision. You can add real-life examples for your customers to relate to or design your own beautiful icons that will match your store‚Äôs style. A visual quiz gets more completions than a fully-text-based one, so make sure to include some images!

![how to build a succesful quiz image6](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image6.jpg)

## 6. Keep it short

*(Max. 5-6 questions)*

This is probably the most important piece of advice on this list. No matter what you do, if your Product Recommendation Quiz is too long, you‚Äôll not see the desired effects. 

Our research shows that most successful quizzes have **max. 5-6 questions**. In other cases, customers typically drop out after question 8 and almost nobody gets to question 12. There‚Äôs power in simplicity! Even if your quiz has some branching, make sure that the total time they spent on the quiz is less than 1-2 minutes.

## 7. Limit the recommended products

*(1-2, or 1 for each type)*

The less choice we have, the less time we spend deciding and the higher the chance we'll buy. Our new `üíéBuilt for Shopify` app gives you powerful tools to create focused, personalized recommendations.

!!! info "Flexible Recommendation System"

    - **Dynamic Recommendations**: Products are recommended based on customer responses, using our intelligent voting system
    - **Fixed Recommendations**: Manually choose specific products for certain answer combinations
    - **Collection Recommendations**: Recommend entire collections instead of individual products - perfect for bundles, seasonal lines, or product types
    - **Recommendation Slots**: Create structured routines by assigning products to specific slots (e.g., cleanser, toner, moisturizer)

Best Practices:

- For simple products: Recommend 1-2 best-matching items
- For routines: Use slots to recommend one product per category
- For collections: Show a curated collection that matches their needs
- Use fixed recommendations for your best-sellers or when you want complete control

The key is to make the choice clear and focused. What's the point of a quiz if you end up with 10 results from which you still need to choose? Keep it simple and watch your conversion rates grow.

![how to build a succesful quiz image7](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image7.png)

## 8. Make it Personalized

*(Recall names & answers)*

Want to make the shopping experience ultra personal? RevenueHunt app lets you use the information provided by the customer and add it to various parts of the quiz. You can, for example, ask for a person‚Äôs name and recall the answer in the next question, on the Results Page or even in the follow-up email. [Information Recalls or Content Dynamic Source](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) are a powerful tool which makes your quiz look professional, while actually being very simple to implement. 

Take a look at this example of a haircare quiz:

![how to build a succesful quiz image8](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image8.gif)

## 9. Send results to the customer if they want

*(Email, Klaviyo, Omnisend, Mailchimp...)*

A well-structured sales funnel, with a Product Recommendation Quiz and a targeted email campaign, can lead to 50% higher conversions. A quiz can serve as an excellent lead collector. Not only are you able to get email addresses or phone numbers via the quiz, but you can also segment your audience based on their quiz answers and follow up with an email tailored to their needs. 

Think about a marketing campaign focused on people living in large urban areas, where a proper morning or evening skin routine is especially important for a clear complexion. Big brands know that a swift follow-up is crucial to maintaining the customer‚Äôs attention. 

With RevenueHunt app, you‚Äôre able to [send quiz results](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/) directly to the customer seconds after completing the quiz. You can even connect your quiz to [Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/) and send the customer a full list of results including product pictures, descriptions, discount codes or instructions for use.

While collecting emails is a very important part of a sales, some customers prefer to take time before trusting your brand with this information. Some customers will leave immediately and some just want to see the results. To ensure the quality of the leads generated by the quiz the RevenueHunt app allows you to **make the email question optional** or even give a customer a choice if they want to see it or not.

## 10. Offer a discount after completing

*(Automatic discounts)*

This one is simple but effective! You want to reward your customers for taking a minute of their time to fill in all this valuable information (for your business). Adding a [discount code](/how-to-guides/add-discount/) at the end of the quiz can be a great way to encourage shoppers to finish the purchase. RevenueHunt app syncs the discount codes you‚Äôve set up in your store and can apply them automatically to every shopping cart.

You can even add a special code to be used at checkout for the people who answer a specific question. For example, a special discount for customers who want both,a day and night routine, to be recommended.

![how to build a succesful quiz image9](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image9.gif)

## 11. Go Global with Shopify Markets

*(Multi-language and multi-currency support)*

Our `üíéBuilt for Shopify` app now fully integrates with Shopify Markets, making it easy to serve customers worldwide with localized experiences:

- **Multiple Languages**: Create separate quiz versions for different languages
- **Automatic Market Detection**: Show the right quiz version based on visitor location
- **Currency Adaptation**: Display prices in local currencies automatically
- **Market-Specific Content**: Customize product recommendations and advice for different regions
- **Seamless Integration**: Works naturally with your Shopify Markets configuration

!!! tip "Best Practices"

    - Create separate quizzes for your main market languages
    - Use market-specific product recommendations when needed
    - Keep quiz logic consistent across versions
    - Test your quiz in different markets to ensure a smooth experience

This powerful integration helps you create a truly global shopping experience while maintaining the personal touch that makes quizzes so effective.

## Plans & Pricing Details

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

- We recently transitioned to a **usage-based pricing model**. All of our plans include all the features, including the Free Plan.
    - Every day, our billing system calculates the responses captured during the **past 30 days (rolling)**. Your plan is based on usage in retrospect.
    - If your quizzes receive more responses than your plan allows in the past 30 days, the app will prompt you to **upgrade to a higher plan**. Conversely, if your usage decreases, you can **downgrade to a lower plan**.
    - We offer **flexible upgrades** and charge only for the proportional days you've been on each plan each month.
    - If you need to **temporarily upgrade for a marketing campaign**, you can downgrade later if your usage decreases.
    - There's no limit to the number of quizzes you can create, even on the Free plan. Our pricing is purely based on quiz usage.
    | Plan Name       | Monthly Fee | Max. Responses | Cost per Response  |
    |-----------------|-------------|----------------|--------------------|
    | Free            | 0 USD/mo.   | 100/mo.        | -                  |
    | Basic           | 39 USD/mo.  | 500/mo.        | 0.080 USD/response |

    | Enterprise 500K | 1399 USD/mo.| 500000/mo.     | 0.003 USD/response |
    If you need to upgrade temporarily for a marketing campaign, you can downgrade later on to a smaller plan if your usage is lower. You can easily do it yourself from the [Plans & Pricing](/reference/plans-pricing/) page in the app.
    Bear in mind that if you need to upgrade/downgrade we‚Äôre very flexible. When changing plans Shopify will automatically discount the proportional part of the monthly plan that hasn‚Äôt been used.
    Billing is handled directly by Shopify. Charges for the app will be visible on your monthly invoice from Shopify. You can change your billing details directly in your Shopify store settings.
    If you have any other questions about billing or refunds, please [contact support](/how-to-guides/contact-customer-support/).
    We will notify you by email and in your Dashboard, when you reach 90%, 100% and 125% of your plan's limit.
    !!! tip
        Make sure to activate the `Send notifications to email` option in the [App Settings > General tab](/reference/app-settings/#general) in order to receive email notifications about your quiz responses limit.
    When you reach 125% of your plan‚Äôs response limit, your quizzes will be locked. Your quizzes will automatically be unlocked again when the number of quiz responses collected during the past 30 days is lower than your plan‚Äôs limit.
    You can delete your responses, but this won‚Äôt affect your monthly quiz usage.
    When you reach your quiz responses limit, your users will see a message like the one below when they try to take your quiz: `This quiz isn‚Äôt accepting new responses`.
    If you‚Äôve just installed the RevenueHunt app, it is advised to stay on a monthly plan for some time to check your quiz usage. 
    Once you‚Äôre sure of what your stable usage is in a month, you can choose to pay for a yearly plan upfront with a reduced monthly rate. To buy a yearly plan, navigate to the [Plans & Pricing tab](/reference/plans-pricing/) in the app and select ‚Äúshow yearly‚Äù.

# Why Your Product Quiz is NOT Converting Well

Product quizzes are a great way to personalize shopping experiences and boost sales, but sometimes they just don‚Äôt hit the mark. If your quiz isn‚Äôt converting as well as you‚Äôd like, you‚Äôre not alone.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jmjHlwEErI?si=a5bEg-I7CrPHPj7T" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

Here are some common reasons why your quiz is not working well and how you can fix it.

## üéØ  You Don‚Äôt Have Clear Goals

If you don‚Äôt know what you want your quiz to achieve, it‚Äôs hard to make it effective. Are you trying to *increase sales*, *gather customer data*, or just *engage your audience*?

Without a clear purpose, your quiz might miss the mark.

**Solution**

Decide what you want your quiz to do. For instance, if you want to boost sales, make sure your questions help guide users to only the products you know they‚Äôll love. Keep track of metrics that show you‚Äôre reaching your goals, like conversion rates and average order value.


| Goal | Solution |
|------|-----------|
| **Increasing Sales** | ‚Ä¢ `Define Sales Objectives`: Set specific targets, like increasing average order value or boosting conversion rates by X%.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Tailored Product Recommendations`: Ensure your quiz directs users to products they are more likely to buy based on their answers and that you don't show too many products on your results page (recommending 1 product that matches all customer criteria is best). |
| **Gathering Customer Data** | ‚Ä¢ `Focus on Insights`: Design questions that help you understand your customers' preferences and behaviors.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Data Collection`: Use the quiz to gather valuable information like email addresses, preferences, and pain points. You can easily [download all the quiz responses](/how-to-guides/download-quiz-responses/) or [connect your quiz to GA4](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) for advanced behavioral analytics. |
| **Engaging Your Audience** | ‚Ä¢ `Interactive Elements`: Include engaging and fun elements like images, videos, and gamified components. Visual quizzes maintain the customer's attention.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Entertainment and Informative Value`: Make sure the quiz is enjoyable and informative, keeping the audience interested but also feeling like they are learning something. |

!!! tip "Tip: Check Metrics"

    Check the [Quiz Metrics & Analytics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/) section for insights on your quiz engagement and sales.

    Our latest article explains which quiz metrics are important and how to improve them: [Product Quiz Metrics: What to Track to Convert Better](/customer-success/track-quiz-metrics-for-better-conversions/)


## ü•± Your Questions Are Boring

If your quiz is boring, users won‚Äôt stick around to finish it. A dull design, lack of interactivity, and uninspiring content can all lead to low engagement.

Long, complex, or irrelevant questions can also drive users away. If your questions are too generic, they won‚Äôt provide a personalized experience.

**Solution**

Make your quiz visually appealing and interactive. Use images, videos, and animations to keep it interesting. Add elements like progress bars and instant feedback to make the experience more fun.

![visually appealing and interactive quiz](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-10-090342-e1720595102774.png)

Keep your questions short, sweet, and to the point. Make sure they‚Äôre relevant to what your customers care about. Use simple language and avoid jargon. Every question should help you understand your customers better or steer them toward the right product.

| Goal | Solution |
|------|-----------|
| **Increasing Sales** | ‚Ä¢ `Interactive Elements`: Use interactive questions and features to keep users interested.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Relevant Questions, Direct Path to Purchase`: Ask only questions that help narrow down the best products for the user. Ensure questions are geared towards identifying products that fit the user's needs.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Product Highlights`: Showcase product benefits and unique selling points throughout the product description in the quiz. |
| **Gathering Customer Data** | ‚Ä¢ `Fun Questions`: Make data-gathering questions fun and engaging.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Rewards for Participation`: Offer incentives for completing the quiz, like [discounts](/how-to-guides/add-discount/) or entries into a giveaway.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Insightful Queries`: Include questions that provide deeper insights into customer preferences and demographics.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Progressive Profiling`: Gradually gather more detailed information with each quiz interaction. |
| **Engaging Your Audience** | ‚Ä¢ `Entertaining Questions`: Use questions that are fun and engaging, such as personality-based or lifestyle questions.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Gamification`: Incorporate elements of gamification, such as progress bars and badges.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Visual Appeal`: Incorporate images and videos to make questions more interesting.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Storytelling`: Use a narrative approach to make the quiz more engaging. |

!!! tip "Tip: Use Picture Questions"

    Use [Picture Questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) to add images or animated gifs to your quiz choices in the RevenueHunt quiz app.

!!! tip "Tip: Upload Images and Videos"

    You can upload [images and videos](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/#adding-images-and-videos) to any quiz question in the RevenueHunt quiz app.


## ü§î Your Results Are Too Generic

If you recommend too many products to the customer, they still will not know what to put in their cart. Recommending too many products ads an extra decision step in the customer‚Äôs shopping journey.

If your quiz results aren‚Äôt personalized, users will feel like they wasted their time. Generic results won‚Äôt make users excited about your products.

**Solution**

Recommend a single product that matches all the customer criteria or a full routine with one product per step. This way the customer will know what to add to cart right away and it will significantly increase your conversion rate.

![single product recommendation](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-10-090001.png)

Use the data from the quiz to give personalized recommendations. Make sure the results are specific to each user‚Äôs answers. Highlight why these products are perfect for them.

| Goal | Solution |
|------|-----------|
| **Increasing Sales** | ‚Ä¢ `Personalized Recommendations`: Provide highly tailored product suggestions based on quiz answers.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Highlight Benefits`: Clearly explain why each recommended product is a great fit for the user. |
| **Gathering Customer Data** | ‚Ä¢ `Detailed Insights`: Offer results that give users a deep understanding of their preferences and needs.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Encourage Profile Completion`: Use results to prompt users to complete their profiles for even more personalized recommendations. |
| **Engaging Your Audience** | ‚Ä¢ `Interactive Results`: Make the results page interactive, with clickable elements that lead to more content or products.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Shareable Outcomes`: Create results that are fun to share on social media, increasing engagement. |


!!! tip 

    Check here how to customize your Results Page for better conversions: [How to Customize Your Results Page](/how-to-guides/edit-results-page/)


## üì¢ Weak Calls to Action (CTAs)

If your CTAs aren‚Äôt clear or strong, users might not know what to do next. This can lead to missed conversions.

**Solution**

Make your CTAs clear and direct. Whether it‚Äôs ‚ÄúShop Now,‚Äù ‚ÄúLearn More,‚Äù or ‚ÄúGet Your Results,‚Äù make sure users know what to do next. Experiment with different texts and placements to see what works best.



| Goal | Solution |
|------|-----------|
| **Increasing Sales** | ‚Ä¢ `Strong CTAs`: Use clear and compelling CTAs like "Shop Now" or "Buy Now."<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Prominent Placement`: Ensure CTAs are prominently placed and easy to find. |
| **Gathering Customer Data** | ‚Ä¢ `Data-Driven CTAs`: Encourage users to provide more information with CTAs like "Tell Us More" or "Complete Your Profile."<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Lead Magnets`: Offer incentives for sharing data, such as [discounts](/how-to-guides/add-discount/) or free samples. |
| **Engaging Your Audience** | ‚Ä¢ `Engagement CTAs`: Use CTAs that encourage further interaction, like "Take Another Quiz" or "Read More Tips."<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Social Sharing`: Include CTAs that prompt users to share their results on social media. |


!!! tip "Tip: Change CTAs"

    You can change the text of any button or CTA in your quiz in the [Quiz Settings > Messages](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#messages) section or directly in each question settings.


## üíå No Follow-Up

The interaction shouldn‚Äôt end with the quiz results. If you don‚Äôt follow up, you miss out on potential sales and customer relationships.

# Quiz Success - üìã Setup Checklist

A step-by-step ‚Äúdon‚Äôt miss anything‚Äù guide before going live.

!!! info
    This checklist isn‚Äôt just theory ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **blueprint for success**. We built it by analyzing our **most successful, best-converting quizzes** from merchants in the beauty and supplements industries. These stores consistently achieve higher engagement, more completed quizzes, and stronger sales results by following these steps.

Think of it as your shortcut: if you follow this setup, you‚Äôll be building your quiz on the same foundation that has already worked for dozens of high-performing brands.

---

### **Step 1 ‚Äì Plan & Name Your Quiz**

Your quiz name sets the tone and expectation. A professional, problem-solving title makes customers take it seriously and increases engagement.


‚òê Define the customer problem your quiz should solve (e.g., find the right moisturizer, build a full routine) and make a quiz map with questions and outcomes.

‚òê Choose a professional name that matches your brand (*Shade Finder*, *Routine Builder*, *Skin Diagnostic*)

??? example "Example: Professional Quiz Name"

    ![quiz name example](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC3-ALPHAH-768x340.jpg)

---


### **Step 2 ‚Äì Build Questions**

Your [questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-types) should be **short, clear, and visual** when possible. Customers drop off if the quiz feels too long or confusing.

‚òê Add a **Welcome** slide that clearly sets expectations ‚Äî explain what the customer will gain from the quiz and how long it will take. Keep it visually engaging and highlight any reward for completion (e.g., a discount code or free gift).

‚òê Keep total length **5‚Äì6 questions** (under 2 minutes)

!!! warning
    We've noticed a significant drop-off in quiz completion rates when the quiz is over 6 questions-long and almost nobody makes it to question 12. Keep the quiz short and concise or it won't achieve the desired results.

‚òê Add **picture questions** for clarity and engagement (skin tones, hair colors, product types)

??? info "How to Add a Picture Question"

    Add a question by clicking `+ Add question` or `+ Add block`. Choose [Picture Choice](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#picture-choice) if you want to show images/icons instead of text-only answers.

    ![picture choice example1](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC6-LUCE-768x242.jpg)

    ![picture choice example2](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC5-TBJ-768x244.jpg)


---


### **Step 3 ‚Äì Add Personalization & Logic**

Personalization makes your quiz feel like a real consultation. [Smart logic](/how-to-guides/use-conditional-logic/) skips irrelevant questions and tailors advice to each customer.

‚òê Use [**Jump Logic**](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/) to branch into relevant paths OR [**Skip Logic**](/how-to-guides/use-skip-logic/) to hide irrelevant questions

??? example "Example: Showing different advice based on previous answers"

    ![jump logic example](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic.png)

    Check this article to learn how to branch the quiz based on previous answers: [How to Use Jump Logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/)


‚òê Add **personalized advice** on the results page (e.g., dry vs oily skin tips) and use [**Display Logic**](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/) for showing targeted advice (e.g., show different advice based on skin type)

??? example "Example: Advice based on calculated skin type"

    ![display logic example](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_variable_example1.png)

    Check this article to learn how to set up a quiz that determines the user's skin type and shows personalized advice and products: [How to Set Up a Winning Variable Quiz](/how-to-guides/set-up-scoring-quiz/#winning-variable-quiz)

‚òê Enable [Information Recalls](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) (e.g., greet by name, reuse answers)

??? example "Example: Recalling information from previous questions"

    ![information recalls example](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC8-Recalls.gif)

    Check this article to learn how to recall information from previous questions: [How to Use Information Recalls](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/)


---

### **Step 4 ‚Äì Configure Recommendations**

The power of a quiz lies in guiding customers to clear choices. Too many results cause decision fatigue, while focused suggestions drive purchases.

‚òê Show only **1 top product**

??? example "Example: Showing one matching product"

    ![recommendations example](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC7-UNDID_Blurred.png){width="500"}

‚òê Use **recommendation slots** for routines, 1 product per slot (cleanser, serum, toner, etc.)

??? example "Example: Skincare routine recommendations"

    ![recommendations example](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/images/how_to_recommend_slots_example.png)
    
    Check this article to learn how to set up a quiz that recommends a skincare routine: [How to Set Up a Funnel Quiz with Slots](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/set-up-funnel-quiz/#funnel-quiz-with-slots)

‚òê Apply a slot with **fixed recommendations** for best-sellers

??? info "How to Set Up Fixed Recommendations"

    Check this article to learn how to set up a quiz that recommends a best-seller: [How to Set Up a Funnel Quiz with Fixed Recommendations](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/set-up-fixed-recommendations-quiz/#always-the-same-recommendations)

---

### **Step 5 ‚Äì Design & Branding**

A quiz that visually matches your store feels like part of your brand and builds trust. Good design keeps the quiz engaging and boosts completion rates.

??? info "How to Customize Quiz Design"

    Check this article to learn how to customize the quiz design: [Customize Quiz Design](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/)

    Note that the `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app automatically pulls your Shopify theme‚Äôs base font.

    ![quiz design example](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC1-OLAPLEX_Blurred-1024x452.png)

‚òê Apply your **store fonts and color scheme**

‚òê Add a **background image** or icons that fit your style

‚òê Use the **visual block editor** to arrange quiz elements

‚òê Add **custom CSS/JS** for advanced tweaks


---

### **Step 6 ‚Äì Capture Leads & Send Results**

Collecting emails turns quiz takers into long-term customers. Sending results builds trust and creates opportunities for follow-up campaigns.

‚òê Add an [**email question**](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#email-address) to gather leads from the quiz

??? tip "Make the email question *optional*"

    To don't hurt your quiz conversions, you can make the email question optional in [email question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#email). This way users will be able to opt-out but still can see their results.

    ![email question settings](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_questions_blocksettings_email.png)


‚òê Enable [result emails](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/) to send results to the quiz takers who left their email

??? info "Tutorial: Sending Emails"

    Check this video tutorial to learn how to send emails with the RevenueHunt app: [Sending Emails](/tutorials/sending-emails/)

‚òê For advanced features, [connect the quiz to your CRM](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-crm/) (eg. Klaviyo, Omnisend, Mailchimp, Webhooks, etc.) and set up a follow-up email campaign

‚òê Personalize emails with quiz answers + product recommendations

---

### **Step 7 ‚Äì Add Incentives**

Rewards encourage customers to act immediately. A discount code is a simple but effective way to boost conversions after the quiz.

‚òê If you haven't yet, add a Welcome slide that clearly sets expectations ‚Äî explain what the customer will gain from the quiz and highlight any **reward for completion**.

‚òê If available for your platform, create and add an [automatic discount code](/how-to-guides/add-discount/) for quiz finishers

‚òê Create a discount code for quiz takers and **add the dicount code as text** to the quiz last question or results page

??? example "Example: Discount Code"

    ![discount code example](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC9-discount.gif)

---

### **Step 8 ‚Äì Publish Your Quiz**

Even the best quiz won‚Äôt help if no one sees it. Make your quiz highly visible across your store to maximize engagement. Most successful quizzes are **published in multiple locations** on the website to help customers at different stages of their shopping journey.

??? tip "Is there anything I can help you with?"

    Just like a real-life shop attendant, the quiz should reach out to the customers to ask *"Is there anything I can help you with?"*. 

    ![publishing your quiz](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC1-UN_DID_Blurred-768x402.png)

??? info "How to Publish Your Quiz"

    Check this article to learn how to publish your quiz in different ways: [How to Publish Your Quiz](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz/)


‚òê Add links to the quiz in the [**navigation menu**](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-link/#link-popup-in-website-menu)

‚òê Add a [**banner with a button**](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-link/#link-popup-as-take-the-quiz-button) to open the quiz

‚òê Add quiz as a [**inline block**](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-inline/#embedding-an-inline-quiz-on-a-dedicated-landing-page) on dedicated landing page or homepage

‚òê Set up an [**automatic popup**](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-automatic-popup/) for first-time visitors

---

### **Step 9 ‚Äì Optimize for Global Stores**

If you sell internationally, your quiz should adapt just like your store. Localization in language, currency, and products builds trust and increases sales abroad.

??? tip "How to Set Up a Quiz for Multiple Markets"

    In Markets tab of the app, assign a quiz to a specific Shopify Market. You can duplicate a quiz and translate it with Copilot for quick multi-language setup.

    Check this video tutorial to learn how to set up a quiz for multiple markets: [Assign Quizzes to Shopify Markets and Languages](/tutorials/shopify-markets/)

‚òê Create separate quizzes for **different languages**

‚òê Test **currency display** in Shopify Markets

‚òê Adjust recommendations for **region-specific needs**

‚òê Test quizzes in multiple markets to confirm smooth experience





---

‚úÖ Done! Your quiz is now ready to guide customers like a real store assistant ‚Äî driving higher engagement, more conversions, and global reach.

# How to Reduce Drop-off and Maximize Quiz Completion Rate

Quizzes can be a powerful tool to engage users, collect valuable data, and even segment your audience for targeted marketing. However, creating a quiz that maintains the user's interest from start to finish can be challenging. High drop-off rates can significantly affect the effectiveness of your quiz.

This guide offers practical steps and strategies to reduce drop-off rates and maximize quiz completion rates.

## Step 1: Review Drop-Off Metrics 

Start by examining the [drop-off metrics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#drop-off) provided by RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz. These metrics will highlight where participants are leaving the quiz, allowing you to pinpoint problem areas effectively.

![drop-off metrics](/images/manual_quizbuilder_metrics_dropoff.png)

!!! warning "Not available for `üíé Built for Shopify` version"

    The Drop-off data is not yet available for the `üíé Built for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app. But you can measure the drop off by connecting the quiz to [Google Analytics](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) or [Meta Pixel](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/).

**Which data to check?**

First, identify `High Drop-off Questions`.  Focus on questions with the highest drop-off rates, especially those asking for personal details like email addresses. These are typically where you might lose participants' interest or willingness to continue.

!!! info "Drop-off Rate Formulas"

    Overall Drop-off Rate: *Drop-off Rate (%) = [(Quiz Starts ‚Äì Quiz Completions) √∑ Quiz Starts] √ó 100* 

    Per-Question Drop-off Rate: *Drop-off Rate at Question i (%) = [(Users who reached Question i ‚Äì Users who reached Question i+1) √∑ Users who reached Question i] √ó 100*

    Completion Rate: *Completion Rate (%) = [Quiz Completions √∑ Quiz Starts] √ó 100*


Then, check the following metrics:

- `Start Rate` - % of page visitors who actually start the quiz. **Why?** Low = landing page headline/CTA issue, slow load, or poor value proposition.

- `Completion Rate` - % of quiz starts that reach the results screen. **Why?** The high-level success metric you‚Äôre trying to improve.

- `Per-Question Exit Rate` - Drop-off % at each question. **Why?** Pinpoints the exact step(s) causing abandonment.

- `Average Time Per Question` - Look for spikes: if one question takes 2‚Äì3√ó longer than others, it‚Äôs either confusing or too demanding.

- `Total Quiz Duration` - Average time from first to last question. **Why?** Compare against your design goal (‚â§60‚Äì90s). Longer times predict higher abandonment.

- `Lead Capture Metrics` - % of users who provide email when asked. **Why?** Check drop-off before vs. after this step ‚Äî forcing email can sink completions.

- `Leads per 100 Quiz Starts` - Combines completion + opt-in. Useful for seeing if completion rate tradeoffs are worth it.



## Step 2: Implement Strategies for Reducing Drop-off

Once you know where the problem is try implementing these strategies to reduce drop-off within your Product Recommendation Quiz:


### Value Up Front

- **Expose the value up front.** First screen: what they get + how long it takes. E.g., ‚ÄúTakes 45s. Get your routine + 10% off.‚Äù

- **Set a time budget.** Design for ‚â§60‚Äì90 seconds total or **max. 5‚Äì8 questions**. Anything longer needs a clear value promise (‚Äú3-step routine + 10% off‚Äù).


### Quiz Length & Flow

- **Kill irrelevant questions with branching.** Use [jump/skip logic](/how-to-guides/use-conditional-logic/) so each path is ‚â§6 questions. If a question doesn‚Äôt change the recommendation, remove it.

- **Sequence for momentum.** Start with the easiest, most visual questions; place the longest/most personal near the end.

- **Offer ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure.‚Äù** Add a neutral choice that still maps to a safe default. Users shouldn‚Äôt feel stuck.

### Question & Answer Design

- **Prefer tap over typing.** Replace text inputs with single-tap choices, sliders, or toggles. If text is unavoidable, one field per screen.

- **Shrink choices.** 3‚Äì6 options per screen; use images or icons; ensure options are mutually exclusive.

- **Keep copy scannable.** 1‚Äì2 short lines max per question. Use helper text only when it changes the answer.

### Email & Data Capture

- **Make email optional and valuable.** Label clearly (‚ÄúOptional‚Äù) and offer a specific incentive (e.g., ‚Äú10% off now‚Äù). Place it after value is built (last or second-to-last step). Make the email question optional in [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings) and clearly indicate this choice to the user.

- **Give results even without email.** Gate extras (PDF routine, detailed guide, bundle pricing) behind email ‚Äî not the core results.

- **Use trust cues at friction points.** Near the email step: ‚ÄúNo spam, unsubscribe anytime,‚Äù privacy link, and social proof (‚Äú2,184 shoppers helped this month‚Äù).


!!! tip "Tip: Email Question"

    Consider the value of obtaining a participant's email. Assess whether the potential long-term benefits, like building your email list for targeted marketing, outweigh the immediate goal of quiz completion.

### UX & Quiz page

- **Show progress the way humans parse it.** ‚Äú3 of 6‚Äù beats ‚Äú50%.‚Äù Keep the total constant (no adding hidden steps mid-flow).

- **Pause competing popups.** While quiz is active, hide newsletter/chat popups and overlays. Resume them after completion.

- **Reduce visual noise.** On the quiz page, hide sticky headers/footers, promo banners, and auto-carousels that steal focus.

- **Result screen matters.** Render the top picks instantly; place secondary content later on the page.

- **Accessibility = completions.** Proper labels, focus order, visible focus state, sufficient contrast. Screen-reader friendly progress (‚ÄúStep 2 of 6‚Äù).


## Step 3: A/B Test

Create a variation of your quiz with the implemented changes, such as making it shorter and adjusting the approach to collecting emails.

Run both the original and the modified quizzes simultaneously to see which version has a higher completion rate.

!!! tip

    Check our [How to A/B Test You Quiz](/how-to-guides/ab-test-quiz/) article for instructions.

## Step 4: Continous Improvement

Use the Product Recommendation Quiz [analytics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#analytics) or [GA4](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) to review the performance of both quiz versions.

Pay attention to the completion rates and participant feedback to understand what works best.

Continuously refine your quiz based on these insights, aiming for an optimal balance between information collection and user experience.

---

By closely monitoring in-app drop-off metrics and experimenting with different quiz formats and strategies, you can improve quiz completion rates.

# Product Quiz Metrics: What to Track to Convert Better

Data from product recommendation quizzes can significantly enhance your conversion rates. Understanding which metrics to track and how to interpret them is key to optimizing your quizzes for better performance. 

Here‚Äôs a guide on the most critical quiz metrics and how they can drive better conversion outcomes.

![product quiz metrics: what to track to convert better image1](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Quiz-Metrics.png)

## Where to find the data?

### ‚û°Ô∏è Quiz Metrics

All the information gathered by your RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz can be found in the [Metrics/Analytics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/) panel. 

- The [Responses](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) section shows all the quiz responses organized by date/timestamp. Click on a date to open a specific response. Each response shows what choices the customer made, which products were upvoted or excluded, which products were recommended, and what customer tags carried out until the results page.

    ![quiz builder metrics responses](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_responses.png)

    ![quiz builder metrics responses details](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_responses_sample1.png)

- The [Analytics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#analytics) section provides graphs on quiz engagement, conversion rate, and revenue. You can analyze the data by date and compare it to past periods or other quizzes.

    ![quiz builder metrics analytics](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_metrics_analytics.png)

- The [Drop Off](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#drop-off) section displays a breakdown percentage of users leaving certain questions in your quiz. The data is shown in a table and graph format.

    ![quiz builder metrics drop off](/images/manual_quizbuilder_metrics_dropoff.png)

    !!! warning "Not available for `üíé Built for Shopify` version"
        The Drop-off data is not yet available for the `üíé Built for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app.

###‚û°Ô∏è Download Raw Data

You can analyze the data there or [download all the responses as a .CSV file](/how-to-guides/download-quiz-responses/) and analyze it in Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel.

![quiz builder metrics responses download](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_responses_exportCSV.png)

###‚û°Ô∏è Advanced Tracking

Additionally, RevenueHunt app offers integrations with [Google Analytics](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) and [Meta Pixel](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/) where additional information like click rate per choice, traffic source or revenue can be collected and measured.


## What to analyze and how to improve?

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Engagement
 

**Quiz Starts and Completions**

Tracking the number of quiz starts and responses/completions is fundamental. High start rates indicate good initial engagement, but the completion rate is what truly matters for conversions. If you notice a drop-off between starts and completions, it might be time to refine your quiz flow or simplify the questions.

![quiz builder metrics analytics starts and completions](/images/cs_track_metrics_starts_responses.png)

!!! note

    `Quiz Starts` refers to the number of people who have engaged with the quiz by passing the first slide. 
    
    `Quiz Responses` refers to the number of people who have completed the quiz, aka. reached the quiz results page. 
    
    If the customer closes the quiz before the results page, this will not be counted as a response/completion.

**Completion Rate**

!!! info "Completion Rate Formula"  

    **Completion Rate (%)** = (Number of Quiz Completions √∑ Number of Quiz Starts) √ó 100


`Completion Rate` is the percentage of people who have engaged with the quiz and completed it. The completion rate is a clear indicator of how engaging and user-friendly your quiz is. A higher completion rate suggests that users find the quiz relevant and easy to navigate, which increases the likelihood of them following through to purchase recommendations. The aim is to keep the completion rate as high as possible, around 90-100%.

![quiz builder metrics analytics completion rate](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/images/manual_quizbuilder_metrics_analytics_comprate.png)

**Drop-off Points / Drop-off Rate**

Identifying where users drop off in your quiz can provide insights into potential friction points. Are users abandoning the quiz at a specific question or step? Use this data to adjust those points, making them more intuitive or engaging.

!!! note
    The `drop-off rate` is measured based on events, which are triggered whenever someone starts a quiz. Some of these start events can be blocked by adblocking plugins in browsers. If you see a difference between the number of quiz starts and the dropoff rate, that is because the number of quiz starts in the analytics tab is automatically adjusted by the algorithm to filter in also the starts blocked by the ad blocker plugin.

!!! warning "Not available for `üíé Built for Shopify` version"
    The Drop-off data is not yet available for the `üíé Built for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app.


| Issue                          | Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Low Quiz Starts**            | - **Make the quiz more visible.** Publish the quiz in multiple ways on your website, send a link to the quiz in your newsletter, or post a link on social media. <br> - **Promote the quiz.** Check [this article](/customer-success/how-to-get-more-quiz-engagement/) for great advice on how to increase your quiz starts. <br> - **Run ads to increase quiz popularity.** If using GA4, check the best traffic sources for your quiz and invest more in them. |
| **Low Completion Rate / High Drop Off** | - **Make the quiz shorter, max. 5-6 questions.** Customers are likely losing attention. <br> - **Add more visuals to the quiz.** Turn multiple-choice questions into picture questions. Add images and videos to your quiz. Visual quizzes have a much higher completion rate than pure text-based ones. <br> - **Check your mandatory questions.** Perhaps customers don‚Äôt want to leave their phone number, name, or email. You can make any question optional in [Question Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings). <br> - **Add personal data questions towards the end of the quiz.** Customers are more likely to stay and leave their data while already invested in the quiz. |


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue
 

**Carts Count and Total Carts Value**

Tracking how many users proceed to cart after completing the quiz can help you gauge the effectiveness of your product recommendations. A high cart count and total cart value indicate that the recommended products resonate well with the users.


![quiz builder metrics analytics carts count and value](/images/cs_track_metrics_number_carts.png)
![quiz builder metrics analytics carts count and value](/images/cs_track_metrics_tot_carts_value.png)

**Average Cart Value**

!!! info "Average Cart Value Formula"  
    
    **Average Cart Value** = Total Carts Value √∑ Carts Count

Understanding the average value of products in the carts can help you assess the monetary impact of your quiz. This metric is crucial for evaluating the overall financial performance and can guide you in setting appropriate pricing strategies.

![quiz builder metrics analytics average carts](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/images/manual_quizbuilder_metrics_analytics_avgcarts.png)

**Number of Orders and Total Orders Value**

For a more direct measure of conversion, track the number of orders placed and their total value, allowing you to directly correlate quiz engagement with sales performance.

!!! warning "Connect your quiz to Shopify Customers and Shopify Revenue Reports"

    Connect your quiz to [Shopify Customers](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-shopify-customers/) (and [Shopify Revenue Reports](/how-to-guides/track-quiz-revenue/?h=shopify+revenue#activate-shopify-revenue-report)) to track the number of orders and their total value.

![quiz builder metrics analytics number of orders and total orders value](/images/cs_track_metrics_orders.png)

**Average Order Value**

!!! info "Average Order Value Formula"  
    
    **Average Order Value** = Total Orders Value √∑ Number of Orders


Monitoring the average order value post-quiz completion provides insights into the spending behavior of your users. It helps in understanding whether the quiz is effectively driving higher-value purchases. By using RevnueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz in your store you should expect the AOV to increase by 20%.

**Conversion Rate**

!!! info "Conversion Rate Formula"  

    **Conversion Rate (%)** = (Number of Purchases after Quiz Completion √∑ Total Number of Quiz Completions) √ó 100


To measure the conversion rate of your quiz, track the number of users who complete the quiz and proceed to make a purchase, then calculate the percentage of these users relative to the total number of quiz completions. This metric is essential because it reveals how effectively the quiz drives sales, aiding in optimizing the quiz design and marketing strategies to maximize revenue.

# How to A/B Test Your Product Recommendation Quiz

A/B testing, or split testing, allows you to compare two versions of your quizzes to see which one performs better. 

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up A/B testing manually using your ability to create, duplicate, and edit quizzes in the RevenueHunt app.

Ensure you have:

- Access to the RevenueHunt app where you can create and edit quizzes.
- Basic understanding of [how to publish quizzes](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz/) on your website.
- Access to your website‚Äôs backend or a platform that allows you to edit HTML/JavaScript for traffic distribution (optional for advanced routing).
- Analytics tools or integration such as  [Google Analytics](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) or [Meta Pixel](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/). to measure quiz performance.

## Step 1: Create Two Versions of Your Quiz

- **Design Your Original Quiz**: Create your quiz (Version A) in the RevenueHunt app, focusing on the content and design that you currently believe will perform best.
- **Duplicate and Modify for Version B**: Use the duplication feature on the dashboard to make a copy of Version A. Alter one or more elements (e.g., title, color scheme, question order) to create Version B. Ensure only one key variable is different to accurately measure the effect of that change. Remember to publish the changes with the top-right Publish button.

## Step 2: Publish Both Versions on Your Website

Deploying both versions of your quiz on your website can be done through simple or advanced methods, depending on your ability to modify your site‚Äôs code and the level of precision you require in your A/B testing.

### No Coding Solution: Basic A/B Testing
For straightforward A/B testing, we recommend publishing each version of the quiz on separate pages within your store. This approach does not require any coding:

- **Inline Quiz on a New Page**: Create a new page for each version of the quiz (Version A and Version B). Follow the [Inline Quiz on a New Page](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-inline/#embedding-an-inline-quiz-on-a-new-page) publishing instructions to embed each quiz into its respective page. 

This method allows you to directly link to each quiz version from different parts of your website or through external marketing channels.

### Coding Solution: Advanced A/B Testing
If you‚Äôre aiming for a more sophisticated A/B testing setup that involves randomizing which quiz version a visitor sees, you‚Äôll need some coding:

- **Link Popup**: Implement a Link Popup method by creating a single entry point (like a button or link) that dynamically directs visitors to either Version A or Version B of the quiz. You will need to work with a developer to program the logic that decides which link to the quiz is shown to each visitor. Follow the [Link Popup Publishing Instructions](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-link/) for detailed steps on how to implement this solution.

By choosing the appropriate method based on your needs and capabilities, you can effectively publish and test different quiz versions on your website to gather insights and improve engagement.

## Step 3: Evenly Distribute Traffic Between Quizzes

To manually distribute traffic:

- For Basic Routing: Use two separate URLs for each quiz version and direct users randomly via your website‚Äôs links or promotions.
- For Advanced Routing: Implement a JavaScript snippet or server-side logic on your landing page that randomly serves Version A or Version B of the quiz to each new visitor.

## Step 4: Track and Analyze Results

- **Set Up Analytics**: Ensure each quiz version has tracking set up. By default, we track the quiz starts, completions, conversion rate, and drop-off in the [Metrics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/) panel. For more advanced analytics, you can connect your quizzes to [Google Analytics](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) or [Meta Pixel](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/).
- **Analyze Performance**: After a significant amount of traffic has interacted with both versions, analyze the data to identify which version achieved better performance based on your predefined goals (e.g., higher completion rates).

## Step 5: Implement Improvements

Based on the analysis, decide which version of the quiz is more effective. Implement the winning elements in your standard quiz and consider new variables to test in future A/B testing cycles.

## Tips for Effective A/B Testing

- Test one variable at a time to understand its impact clearly.
- Ensure you have a statistically significant sample size before drawing conclusions.


---
A/B testing for quizzes is entirely feasible with the RevenueHunt app. By following this guide, you can uncover valuable insights into what resonates with your audience, leading to better engagement and conversion rates over time.

# How to Add and Adjust Images in the Quiz


There are several ways you can add images to your quiz in the RevenueHunt app.

This article explains how you can add images to your quiz and provides tips on how to optimize the image quality for the best quiz performance.


## Images in the Quiz

There are the different ways you can add images to your quiz in the RevenueHunt app:

- **[Quiz Background image](/how-to-guides/add-adjust-images/#quiz-background-image)** - You can uplaod a background image for the whole quiz via the [Quiz Design tab](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/).

- **[Question Background/Split image](/how-to-guides/add-adjust-images/#question-backgroundsplit-image)** - You can upload a background image to each question in the quiz via the [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#picture-choice).

- **[Image Block](/how-to-guides/add-adjust-images/#image-blocks)** - You can upload an individual image via an Image Block directly into one of the quiz [questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) or [results page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/).

- **[Picture Choice](/how-to-guides/add-adjust-images/#picture-choices)** - You can add a [Picture Choice block](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#picture-choice) to your question, which will allow you to add an image to each choice in that multiple choice question.

- **[Product Image](/how-to-guides/add-adjust-images/#product-image)** - You can also add a [Product/Variants/Collection Block](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#product-image-in-productvariantscollection-blocks) to your quiz results page, which will allow you to display a product/variant/collection image in the results page.


### Quiz Background Image

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

You can upload a background image for the whole quiz via the [Quiz Design tab](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/).
    ![how_to_improve_image_quality_backgroudimagequiz](/images/how_to_improve_image_quality_backgroudimagequiz.png)
    1. Open your quiz and navigate to the [Quiz Design tab](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/). In the Quiz Design section of the quiz builder you can change how the quiz Questions or the Results Page look.
    2. Our theme editor allows you to pick one of our multiple color palettes, choose from multiple fonts and add a default background image to your quiz.
        ![manual_quizbuilder_quizdesign_edittheme](/images/manual_quizbuilder_quizdesign_edittheme.png){width="300"}
        `Background` - Opens a color menu that allows you to change the color of the quiz background. You can add a custom color by pasting the #number of the color (for example, #ecb3b3).
        `Background image` - Click "Add" to upload a background image. Image should be max 1000px x 1000px and 2MB. An extra menu appears once activated.
        `Background Opacity` - A slider that allows you to adjust the opacity of the uploaded background image.
    !!! tip "Background image Tip"
        Our app uses a **responsive design**, meaning your quiz will adjust to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile). Because of this, **background images may crop or scale differently depending on the device**.
        To ensure your background looks great across all devices, we recommend:
        ‚úÖ Use high-resolution images of **max. 1000px x 1000px size**.
        ‚úÖ Avoid images with text ‚Äî it might be cut off or obscured
        ‚úÖ If needed, keep important elements (like logos or text) centered
        ‚úÖ Use soft, neutral backgrounds that won‚Äôt clash with quiz content
        ‚úÖ Test your quiz on different devices to see how the image behaves
        Remember, simpler is often better for responsive backgrounds!     
    !!! tip "Higher resolution images"
        You can use [Quiz Design > Custom CSS console](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/#custom-css) to upload a background image for the whole quiz in a desired resolution.
        Sample code:
        ```html	
        .lq-bg-img, .lq-bg-img-only, .widget .lq-bg-img, .widget .lq-bg-img-only {
            background-image: url('https://your-image-url.com/image.jpg');
            background-size: cover;
            background-position: center;
        }
        ```
    !!! tip "Different background images for mobile and desktop"
        With Custom CSS in [Quiz Design > Custom CSS console](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/#custom-css), you can also uplaod a different background image for mobile and desktop. For this your developer can use CSS media queries to target different screen sizes.
        Sample code:
        ```html
        @media (max-width: 768px) {
            .lq-bg-img, .lq-bg-img-only, .widget .lq-bg-img, .widget .lq-bg-img-only {
                background-image: url('https://your-image-url.com/image-mobile.jpg');
            }
        }
        ```
    You can upload a different background image to each question in the quiz via the [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#picture-choice).  
    ![how_to_improve_image_quality_backgroudimagequestion](/images/how_to_improve_image_quality_backgroudimagequestion.png)
    1. Go to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and click on the question you want to add an image to.
    2. Click on the `wrench` icon to open the [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).
    3. Find the `Image` section in the question settings and click `Add` to upload a featured image to the question. An extra menu appears once activated.
        `above` - Places the uplaoded image above the question, on top of the slide.
        `below` - Places the uplaoded image below the question, above the choices.
        `background` - Places the uplaoded image on the background of the slide (overrides the defautl quiz background).
        `split` - Places the uploaded image on the side of the slide. Splits the sldie into two. On mobile, the image is placed on top of the question.
        `Image Opacity` - A slider which allows to adjust the opacity of the uplaoded image.
    !!! tip "Uploaded image Tip"
        Our app uses a **responsive design**, meaning your quiz will adjust to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile). Because of this, **uploaded images may crop or scale differently depending on the device**.
        To ensure your uploaded images look great across all devices, we recommend:
        ‚úÖ Use high-resolution images of **max. 1000px x 1000px size**.
        ‚úÖ Avoid images with text ‚Äî it might be cut off or obscured
        ‚úÖ If needed, keep important elements (like logos or text) centered
        ‚úÖ Use soft, neutral backgrounds that won‚Äôt clash with quiz content
        ‚úÖ Test your quiz on different devices to see how the image behaves
        Remember, simpler is often better for responsive backgrounds!     
    !!! tip "Higher resolution images"
        You can use [Quiz Design > Custom CSS console](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/#custom-css) to upload  a background/split image for the whole quiz in a desired resolution.
        Sample code:
        ```html	
        .lq-bg-img, .lq-bg-img-only, .widget .lq-bg-img, .widget .lq-bg-img-only {
            background-image: url('https://your-image-url.com/image.jpg');
            background-size: cover;
            background-position: center;
        }
        ```
    !!! tip "Different images for mobile and desktop"
        With Custom CSS in [Quiz Design > Custom CSS console](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/#custom-css), you can also uplaod different images for mobile and desktop. For this your developer can use CSS media queries to target different screen sizes.
        Sample code:
        ```html
        @media (max-width: 768px) {
            .lq-bg-img, .lq-bg-img-only, .widget .lq-bg-img, .widget .lq-bg-img-only {
                background-image: url('https://your-image-url.com/image-mobile.jpg');

# How to Add a Discount to Your Quiz

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

Adding discount coupons into your quiz allows customers to enjoy special offers on the results page or through a follow-up email. 
    ![how to add a discount example](/images/how_to_add_a_discount_example.png){width="300"}
    This guide explains how to implement Discount Coupons for Checkout with the RevenueHunt app.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/36ed1600df294287bf24d94bc438d4c3?sid=7c53ed8e-ab4c-4276-88bd-0509cdf954b9" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    **Step 1: Generate a Discount Code**
    To create a Shopify discount code, refer to [this helpful guide](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/discounts/create-discount-codes#create-a-fixed-value-or-percentage-discount). Activation of this code is necessary before integrating it with your quiz to ensure functionality at checkout. 
    It's essential to select the `manual` option for discount codes in Shopify, as our app can only synchronize with manually created codes.
    !!! note
        Please remember, that the management of these discounts is handled through Shopify, not directly within our app.
    **Step 2: Configure Your Discount Code on the Results Page**
    You can add Static or Dynamic discount codes to your quiz.
    **Static Discount**
    1. Navigate to [Results Page Settings > Discount Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#discounts-settings) and access the Discount Code Settings section. 
    2. Here, you'll find a `Code` field. This field is for entering the discount code that will be automatically applied at checkout.
        ![how to add discount static](/images/manual_quizbuilder_resultspage_settings_discount_discountcode.png){width="300"}
        `Visible discount` - Select the `discount %` from the dropdown. The percentage discount will be visible on the results page products. The discount code will be automatically redeemed at checkout.
        `Code` - Type a discount code that corresponds to this discount. You have to set up this discount code in your store > Shopify Discounts first.
    **Dynamic Discount**
    Our system supports the addition of multiple Shopify discount codes on the results page, applied dynamically according to the cart's total value. 
    1. Start by creating your Shopify discount codes as explained in [Step 1](#step-1-generating-a-discount-code-in-shopify). 
        !!! note
            Remember, only manual discount codes are compatible with our app.
    2. Proceed to the quiz's Results Page tab. Within [Results Page Settings > Discounts](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#discounts-settings), activate Dynamic Discounts. Click "activate" to open the discount menu.
        ![how to add discount dynamic](/images/manual_quizbuilder_resultspage_settings_discount_dynamicdiscounts.png){width="300"}
        `Enable notifications` - A toast notification will appear when a customer qualifies for a discount. Toggle to enable/disable.
        `Encourage discounts` - The notification will also include a message telling the customer how close they are to receiving the next highest discount. Toggle to enable/disable.
        **Discount [A] Settings**
        `Discount code` - Type a discount code that corresponds to this discount. You have to set up this discount code in your store > Shopify Discounts first.
        `Discount percentage` - Type the discount %. The percentage discount will be visible in the results page products. The discount code will be automatically redeemed at checkout.
        `Min. value in cart` - Type the value of products added to the cart on the results page above which the discount will be applied.
        `+ / add another discount` - Adds a new dynamic discount (Discount [B]).
        `bin / delete this discount` - deletes this dynamic discount.
        `add a discount` - Adds a new dynamic discount below (Discount [B]).
        `deactivate` - Deactivates dynamic discounts.
    **Step 3: Publish Changes**
    1. Click the top-right [`Publish` button](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) to apply your changes to the live quiz/preview.
    **Alternatively**
    Your developer can also add a discount code to the results page using custom JavaScript code added to the Results page.
    !!! info
        Check out [this article](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) for more information on how to add custom JavaScript code to your results page.
    !!! example 
        You can use this function 
        ```html
        /* set specific discount code \*/
        prq.setDiscountCode('10-OFF'); 
        ```
        to add a custom coupon or a discount code to the results page and apply it to all the products. Note, that this coupon code needs to be first set up in your store.
    To further personalize the customer experience, you can incorporate the discount code within the follow-up email and results page. This allows customers to conveniently copy and paste the code at checkout.
    Simply go to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/), find the [Notifications > TO RESPONDENT](/reference/quiz-builder/notifications/#to-respondent) tab, and edit the message to include your discount code text.
    !!! info
        Check out [this article](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/) for more information on how to set up and customize the quiz result email.
    In RevenueHunt app, it is possible to apply a discount at checkout only for the customers who leave their email in the quiz. To set this up you need to follow these steps:
    1. **Create multiple results pages**: To do that, go to the [`Results Page Settings -> Advanced -> Multiple Results Pages`](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#multiple-results-pages-settings) and click ``Activate`. [Multiple Results Pages Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#multiple-results-pages-settings) screen will appear and a second Results page will be added.
        ![how to add discount multiple result pages](/images/manual_quizbuilder_resultspage_settings_multipleresultspages.png){width="300"}
    2. You can then rename the page and edit it by clicking `edit`.
        ![how to add discount result pages](/images/how_to_add_discount_result_pages.png)
    3. **Add discount code**: In this case, *Results Page 1* will be left as default with no discount and the discount will be applied to *Results Page 2*. To do that, open the `Results Page 2 Settings -> Discount code settings -> Discount code` and click `add`. You can then edit the `Visible % discount` and add the code.
        !!! warning
            For the discount to work, you need to set it up first in your Shopify store. Check the [first part of this article](#how-to-add-a-discounts-to-your-quiz) for instructions.
    4. **Add a discount question**: Next, navigate to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add a `discount question` by clicking `+`. 
        ![how to add discount discount question](/images/how_to_add_discount_discount_question.png)
    5. **Add an email question**: Then, add an `email question` by clicking `+`.
        ![how to add discount email question](/images/how_to_add_discount_email_question.png)
    5. **Add Jump Logic**: Now you can redirect customers to either the *Results Page 1 (no discount)* or the *Results Page 2 (discount)* depending on their answer to the discount question. To do that you‚Äôll need to add two Jump Logic statements.
        !!! tip
            To learn more about Jump Logic, check [this article](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/).
    6. **FIRST JUMP LOGIC ‚Äì DISCOUNT QUESTION**: To add Jump Logic to the discount question, click the `conditional logic` button. In the `Jump Logic` menu, select `Add Jump Logic`. Add the following logic condition:
        ![how to add discount jump logic 1](/images/how_to_add_discount_jump_logic_1.png)
        - If the customer answers ‚ÄòYes‚Äô to the discount question, they will automatically go to the next question (the email question).
        - If the customer answers ‚ÄòNo‚Äô to the discount question, they will be automatically redirected to the *Results Page 1 (no discount)*.
    7. **SECOND JUMP LOGIC ‚Äì EMAIL QUESTION**: Next, you‚Äôll have to add Jump Logic to the email question. In this case, it is enough to always send the customer to the *Results Page 2 (discount)* with the `Always Jump to...` function.
        ![how to add discount jump logic 2](/images/how_to_add_discount_jump_logic_2.png)
    8. **Test the quiz**: Once the discounts are set up, update the preview/live quiz with the `Publish` button. Then, test the quiz by clicking the `Preview` button in the top right corner of the app.

    - add custom behavior, images, texts or logic
    - change quiz layout
    - display custom product recommendations
    - forward to any particular page on your store
    - add tracking codes to specific questions (Google Analytics, Meta Pixel)
    - and more

This guide will walk you through adding JavaScript to quiz questions and the results page. 

!!! warning "For developers and Shopify Partners"
    This guide is meant for developers and Shopify Partners. If you're not familiar with the basics of JavaScript and the Vue.js framework, it is advised to ask for help from a professional to implement this. You can find/hire a developer [here](https://experts.shopify.com/).

## Access the Custom JavaScript Console

You can add custom JavaScirpt to the quiz results page and the quiz questions.

### Results Page

### Example 3: Multiple-choice questions: select all, select none

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

1. Navigate to the [Results Page Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) in the Quiz Builder.
    2. Select [**Advanced Settings**](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#advanced-settings).
    3. Scroll down to find the **Custom JavaScript** section and click `add`.
    4. This is your canvas for crafting and deploying custom scripts that can modify the quiz's behavior based on user interactions and results.
    5. Remember to click the `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.

    4. This is your canvas for crafting and deploying custom scripts that can modify the quiz's behavior based on user interactions and results.
    5. Remember to click the `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.
    To begin, let's log the quiz response object to the console:
    ```javascript
    console.log(prq);
    ```
    This line of code will display the available Vue.js functions and properties within the prq scope in your browser's console, allowing you to inspect the quiz data in real-time.
    ![how to add javascript consolelog](/images/how_to_add_javascript_consolelog.png)
    **Custom JavaScript Capabilities**
    The `prq` object is your gateway to customizing the quiz experience. Here's how you can use it:
    **Quiz Data Manipulation**
    - **Accessing Quiz Slides and Responses**: Use `prq.quizSlides()` to retrieve all quiz slides/questions, including user responses.
    - **Fetching Specific Slide Values**: Obtain the value of a particular slide by using `prq.getSlideValue(slideId)`.
    **Participant Information Retrieval**
    - **Lead Details**: Easily fetch the quiz participant's email, phone number, and name using `prq.leadEmail()`, `prq.leadPhone()`, and `prq.leadName()`, respectively.
    **Results Page Customization**
    - **Manipulating Results Page Content**: Access and modify the contents of the results page, including blocks and products, using `prq.resultsPage()`.
    - **Product Recommendations**: Leverage `prq.recommendedProducts()` and `prq.mostVotedProduct()` to customize product suggestions.
    - **Automatic Actions**: Automatically add products to the cart or proceed to checkout using `prq.addAllToCart()` and `prq.checkout()`.
    - **Discount Codes**: Apply specific discount codes with `prq.setDiscountCode('10-OFF')`.
    **Navigation and Engagement**
    - **Quiz Navigation**: Offer options to retake the quiz, close it, or open it in a popup through `prq.retakeQuiz()`, `prq.closeQuiz()`, and `window.openQuizPopup('quizID')`.
    ```html
    /* List of all the quiz slides/questions (including the responded values) */
    prq.quizSlides();
    /* get the slide/question value by passing the slide ID  */
    prq.getSlideValue(slideId);
    /* get the lead's email  */
    prq.leadEmail();
    /* get the lead's phone  */
    prq.leadPhone();
    /* get the lead's name  */
    prq.leadName();
    /* List contents of the results page, blocks, products, etc. */
    prq.resultsPage();
    /* List recommended products, sorted by number of votes */
    prq.recommendedProducts();
    /* Show most voted product */
    prq.mostVotedProduct();
    /* adds all the products to cart automatically */
    prq.addAllToCart();
    /* proceeds to cart/checkout automatically */
    prq.checkout();
    /* set specific discount code \*/
    prq.setDiscountCode('10-OFF');
    /* get the response permalink url */
    prq.getResponsePermalink();
    /* retake quiz */
    prq.retakeQuiz();
    /* close quiz */
    prq.closeQuiz();
    /* open quiz popup */
    window.openQuizPopup('dbqHqN');
    dbqHqN is the quiz ID
    ```
    For other functions and properties refer to the [console.log(prq)](#consolelogprq-function).
  	```javascript
    // Data (live getters always return the latest state)
    Quiz.currentQuestion        // current question (index or object)
    Quiz.questions              // array of all questions
    Quiz.answers                // answers so far (by questionRef)
    Quiz.variableScores         // e.g., { skinSensitivity: 82, hydration: 45, ... }
    Quiz.highestVariableRef     // key/name of the highest-scoring variable
    // Navigation
    Quiz.next()                 // go to next question
    Quiz.previous()             // go to previous question
    // One-shot routing helper (next click will go to this q-or-r ref, then clears)
    Quiz.overrideNext('q-or-r-ref')
    // Event: fires after any answer update (choices/inputs)
    // event shape: { questionRef, blockRef, type, choicesRefs, value, isValid, selectedIndex, selectedLabel }
    Quiz.onChange = (event) => { /* your logic */ }
    // DOM helpers (scoped to the quiz)
    Quiz.querySelector(selector)  // like document.querySelector, but inside the quiz
    Quiz.getElementById(id)       // like document.getElementById, but inside the quiz
    // Examples:
    // 1) Route based on score (send next to a specific result)
    if (Quiz.variableScores.skinSensitivity > 80) {
      Quiz.overrideNext('r-premium');
    }
    // 2) React to answer changes and steer Next dynamically
    Quiz.onChange = (e) => {
      const answers = Quiz.answers; // live snapshot
      // decide destination based on current answers/scores
      Quiz.overrideNext('q-12345678');
    };
    ```
    **Results Page**
    ```javascript
    // Data
    Quiz.currentResult        // the result object (e.g., profile/outcome)
    Quiz.answers              // final answers
    Quiz.slotItems            // product recommendations shown in slots
    Quiz.variableScores       // scoring variables
    Quiz.highestVariableRef   // key/name of the highest scoring variable
    // Actions (async)
    await Quiz.addAllToCart()     // add all recommended products to cart
    await Quiz.applyDiscountCode()// apply the discount code configured
    // DOM helpers (scoped inside the quiz)
    Quiz.querySelector(sel)       // like document.querySelector, scoped to quiz
    Quiz.getElementById(id)       // like document.getElementById, scoped to quiz
    ```
    **Debugging and Accessing Data in V2**
    To explore available data in the `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app, you can add a `debugger` statement to your JavaScript code:
    ```javascript
    debugger;
    // Your code goes here
    ```
    When you view the quiz in your browser with Developer Tools open (F12), the code execution will pause at the debugger statement. In the Sources tab, you'll see the available parameters like `currentResult`, `answers`, and `slotItems`:
    ![debugger statement in browser](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_debugger_browser.png)
    You can then:
    1. Hover over these variables to inspect their values
    2. Use the console panel while paused to evaluate expressions
    3. Type these object names in the console to examine their structure
    Alternatively, you can use console.log to output these objects to the console:
    Questions
    ```javascript
    console.log('Current Question:', Quiz.currentQuestion);
    console.log('All Questions:', Quiz.questions);
    console.log('Answers so far:', Quiz.answers);
    console.log('Scores:', Quiz.variableScores);
    console.log('Top variable:', Quiz.highestVariableRef);
    ```
    Results Page
    ```javascript
    console.log('Current Result:', Quiz.currentResult);
    console.log('Final Answers:', Quiz.answers);
    console.log('Product Recommendations:', Quiz.slotItems);
    console.log('Scores:', Quiz.variableScores);
    console.log('Top variable:', Quiz.highestVariableRef);
    ```
    To access the console in your browser:
    1. Right-click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect" or press F12
    2. Click on the "Console" tab
    3. Look for your logged output
    This will help you understand the structure of these objects so you can access the specific properties you need in your custom JavaScript.
    You can do it two ways: 
    1. Create an element in the result page and add the `onclick` functionality later via the Custom Javascript.
        !!! example "Add the `onclick` functionality via the Custom Javascript."
            ```html
            <!-- In Result page in a HTML block -->
            <!-- add a HTML element such as -->
            <a id="special_retake_quiz">Click here to retake the quiz</a>
            ```
            ```javascript
            /* In the Custom Javascript section */
            // get the element
            var element = document.getElementById("special_retake_quiz");
            // add the onclick function to the element
            element.onclick = function() {
                prq.retakeQuiz();
            }
            ```
    2. Or you can create the element in the Custom Javascript section with an `onclick` event first and then inject it in the results page.
        !!! example "Create the element with an `onclick` event first and then inject it in the results page."
            ```javascript
            /* In the Custom Javascript section */
            // create the element
            var element = document.createElement("a");
            element.innerHTML = "Click here to retake the quiz"
            // add the onclick function to the element
            element.onclick = function() {
                prq.retakeQuiz();
            }
            // get element that we are going to append in the result
            // in this case at the end of the first block
            var destination_element = document.querySelectorAll(".lq-block")[0];
            destination_element.appendChild(element);
            ```
    You can display the information you have gathered throughout the quiz and mash it up however you want. For example, you could create a BMI (body mass index) calculator the following way.
    !!! example "Create a BMI calculator"
        ```html
        <!-- In Result page in a HTML block -->
        <!-- add an HTML element such as -->
        <div id="body_mass_index_calculation"></div>
        ```
        ```javascript
        /* In the Custom Javascript section */
        // get the element
        var element = document.getElementById("body_mass_index_calculation");
        // get the values of the slides
        var weight = prq.getSlideValue("rgiq0oE");
        var height = prq.getSlideValue("0Mi2qLN");
        // instead of using prq.getSlideValue you could do the same with this code:
        /*
        var slide_weight = prq.quiz.attributes.slides.data.find(s => s.id === "rgiq0oE");
        var slide_height = prq.quiz.attributes.slides.data.find(s => s.id === "0Mi2qLN");
        var weight = slide_weight.attributes.values[0];
        var height = slide_height.attributes.values[0];
        */
        // calculate the Body Mass Index
        var bmi = weight / (height * height);
        // insert the calculation on the element in the result page
        element.innerHTML = bmi.toFixed(2); 
        ```
    You can also load jQuery [this way](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10113366/load-jquery-with-javascript-and-use-jquery).
    It is possible to make the quiz multiple choice questions select all preceding answers and none of the answers with custom JavaScript code. You will be able to use it as long as there is only one choice that contains the word "All" and one that contains the word "None".  It doesn't matter the order or the question number.
    ??? example "Select all, select none"
        This code may require adjustments by a developer.  Use it as an example only.
        ```javascript
        // Initializes an object to hold the current slide's state, ensuring it doesn't overwrite if already exists.
        var prq = prq || {
          currentSlide: {
            values: [], // An array to store the values (identifiers) of selected choices.
          },
        };
        // Selects all elements with class `.lq-choice` as the choices available on the current slide/view.
        const choices = document.querySelectorAll(".lq-choice");
        // Retrieves the currently selected choice values from the global state.
        var values = prq.currentSlide.values;
        // Iterates over each choice and attaches a click event listener to handle selection/deselection.
        choices.forEach((selector) => {
          selector.addEventListener("click", function () {
            refresh(this.id); // Calls the refresh function on click, passing the clicked choice's ID.
          });
        });
        // Defines the logic to update choice selections based on user interaction.
        function refresh(id) {
          var choice = document.getElementById(id); // Retrieves the DOM element for the clicked choice.
          // Logic to deselect a choice if it's already selected.
          if (valuesIncludes(values, choice)) {
            values = removeChoice(values, choice);
          } 
          // Logic to select all choices except "none" when "all" is clicked.
          else if (isAll(choice)) {
            const cs = [...choices].filter((c) => !isNone(c));
            values = cs.map((c) => choiceId(c));
          } 
          // Logic to handle "none" selection, deselecting all other choices or selecting none only.
          else if (isNone(choice)) {
            if (valuesIncludes(values, choice)) {
              values = [];
            } else {
              const cs = [...choices].filter((c) => !isNone(c));
              values = [choiceId(choice)];
            }
          } 
          // General logic for ticking a choice and unticking "none".
          else {
            addChoice(values, choice);
            values = removeChoice(values, choiceNone(choices));
          }
          // Updates the UI to reflect the current selection state.
          choices.forEach((c) =>
            values.includes(choiceId(c))
              ? c.classList.add("lq-selected")
              : c.classList.remove("lq-selected")
          );
        }
        // Helper function to add a choice's ID to the selection.
        function addChoice(values, choice) {
          values.push(choiceId(choice));
        }
        // Helper function to remove a choice's ID from the selection.
        function removeChoice(values, choice) {
          return values.filter((v) => v !== choiceId(choice));
        }
        // Returns the "none" choice element.
        function choiceNone(choices) {
          return [...choices].find((c) => isNone(c));
        }
        // Unused in the given code but presumably intended to return the "all" choice element.
        function choiceAll(choices) {
          return [...choices].find((c) => isAll(c));
        }
        // Extracts and returns the ID part of a choice's DOM ID.
        function choiceId(choice) {
          return choice.id.split("-")[1];
        }
        // Determines if a choice is meant to select all options.
        function isAll(c) {
          return c.innerHTML.toLowerCase().includes("all");
        }
        // Determines if a choice represents a "none" selection.
        function isNone(c) {
          return c.innerHTML.toLowerCase().includes("none");
        }
        // Checks if the current selection includes a specific choice's ID.
        function valuesIncludes(values, c) {
          return values.includes(choiceId(c));
        }
        ```
    Our application syncs only the base products from your store. Products translated into other languages won't have unique IDs for sync. Although you can change the quiz language, product names and descriptions will display in the original language. 
    A workaround for this could be creating quizzes in different languages and redirecting users to the translated product pages with JavaScript. We explain this approach in [this article](/how-to-guides/change-quiz-language/#step-3-redirect-to-translated-product-url).

# How to Add Product Metafields/Attributes

This article explains how to add product metafields/attributes to products on your quiz's results page.

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

!!! note
        The app can only sync and show the custom text product metafields.
    [Metafields](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/custom-data/metafields) in Shopify are used by stores to display specific product properties that aren't shown by default on e-commerce platforms. For instance, in Germany, it's required to show the "grundpreis" or `per 100ml` price for cosmetic products. Metafields make this possible.
    If you're looking to import product metafields from your store into the Product Recommendation Quiz to display them on your quiz's results page, follow the steps outlined below:
    **Step 1: Enable Metafields Display**
    First, enable the display of metafields for individual products:
    1. Navigate to your [Results Page Settings > Basic](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#basic-settings).
    2. Open the `Individual Product Settings` section.
    3. Activate the `show metafields` toggle.
    ![Enable Metafields Display](/images/how_to_add_metafields_step_1.gif)
    **Step 2: Open App Settings**
    Open [App Settings > Catalogue](/reference/app-settings/#catalogue) to access the settings to manage your catalog.
    **Step 3: Select Metafields**
    Select the Metafields namespaces you want to sync with the app by clicking the toggle icon next to each.
    ![Select Metafields](/images/how_to_add_metafields_step_3.gif)
    **Step 4: Sync the Catalog**
    Update your catalog with the new metafields by triggering a [catalog sync](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/) from your dashboard.
    **Step 5: Implement Custom JavaScript on the Results Page**
    To display the metafield values on your results page, [custom JavaScript](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) is required:
    1. Your developer will need to write custom JavaScript code to render the metafield value in the desired location on the results page.
    2. This customization falls outside the support scope of our app.
    Here's a sample code that replaces the product description with the `descriptors-subtitle` metafield. This code should be added in the [Custom JavaScript](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) input under [Results Page Settings > Advanced Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#advanced-settings):
    ```javascript
    window.recommendedProducts = prq.recommendedProducts();
    var products = document.querySelectorAll('.lq-product');
    for (let i = 0; i < products.length; i++) {
      let id = products[i].id;
      let oneId = id.match(/^\d/) ? ("#\\3" + id.charAt(0) + " " + id.substring(1)) : "#" + id;
      let product = window.recommendedProducts.find(product => product.id === id);
      if (product.metafields['descriptors-subtitle']) {
        let toEdit = document.querySelectorAll(oneId + ' .lq-hcont');
        for (let j = 0; j < toEdit.length; j++) {
          if (!toEdit[j].hasAttribute("edited")) {
            toEdit[j].insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', '<span>' + product.metafields['descriptors-subtitle'] + '</span>');
            toEdit[j].setAttribute("edited", "true");
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    ![manual_standalone_succcesschecklist_productfeed](/images/manual_standalone_succcesschecklist_productfeed.png)


    !!! warning 

        You cannot just upload any data source file to the RevenueHunt app. The file must be a **valid Google Product Feed XML file**. Check this [guide](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/12631822?hl=en) to learn more about the best practices for creating a valid Google Product Feed.
    

    !!! info "How do I find my Google Product Feed URL?"

        To find your Google Product Feed URL in Google Merchant Center:

        1. Log into your account at [https://merchants.google.com/](https://merchants.google.com/)
        2. Click `Products`, then `Manage product sources`.
        3. Click the name of your desired data source to open the data source settings.
        4. Under `Data source setup` check the `File URL` field and copy the URL.

        6. Click `Save` to save the changes.

    !!! tip "Host the file somewhere public"

        Alternatively, you can also host your XML file somewhere public. For example:

        - Shopify (if your store is on Shopify): Go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Files` in your Shopify admin. Upload `google_product_feed.xml`. Copy the URL Shopify gives you (it will look like `https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/.../google_product_feed.xml`).

        - Your own website / hosting: Upload the file via FTP, cPanel File Manager, or your CMS‚Äôs media upload.

        - Cloud storage: Use Dropbox, Google Drive (with direct link), or Amazon S3 ‚Äî but make sure the link is public and ends with `.xml`.

2. Once the link is added, the app will automatically upload products and collections to your quiz account.


    !!! warning "Your Google Product Feed doesn't work?"

        First, make sure that your file is a valid Google Product Feed XML file. Review the Google [Documentation](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/12631822?hl=en) guide.

        You should also try [this validation service](https://developers.google.com/product-review-feeds/validation/) to check for problems.

        If you still have issues, please [contact our support team](/how-to-guides/contact-customer-support/) and we'll be happy to help you.

# Why Products Aren't Added to the Cart?

If your products are not added to the cart, here are the most probable causes:

## Your quiz is not published on a live website

The quiz needs to be published on live website (not hidden by a ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù plugin or password). 

!!! tip

    Check [this article](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz/) to learn how to publish your quiz.

## You‚Äôre using a cart drawer

Our RevenueHunt app does not integrate with drawer carts at the moment. So after the quiz is over, the quiz is adding products to the ‚Äúregular‚Äù cart instead of the drawer cart in your theme.

!!! warning "Cart Drawer"

    Check this article: [How to Update Your Shopify Cart Drawer Products After the Quiz](/how-to-guides/update-shopify-cart-drawer/) 

    This guide explains:

    - How RevenueHunt quiz app adds products to the Shopify cart

    - Why the cart drawer may not update

    - What your theme editor or developer can do to fix it

Unfortunately, drawer carts are an added functionality by specific store themes, not a core Shopify feature. Because of that, we cannot integrate with all the different themes that have drawer carts at the moment. However, there are a few ways this can be solved. Check the [How to Update Your Shopify Cart Drawer Products After the Quiz article](/how-to-guides/update-shopify-cart-drawer/) for more information.

**Option 1: Configure your Shopify theme to handle cart updates**

If you configure your Shopify theme to handle cart updates, it may be possible to integrate with drawer carts directly from the quiz.
    
!!! tip

    Check [this article](/how-to-guides/update-shopify-cart-drawer/) to learn how quiz adds products to the cart and how to configure your Shopify theme to handle cart updates.

**Option 2: Send the customer to the product page**

You could, instead of adding the product to the cart, send the customer to the product page by changing the checkout settings. They will be able to add the product to the drawer cart from there.

!!! tip

    Check [this article](/how-to-guides/change-checkout-settings/) to learn how to change your checkout settings.


## Your product is a subscription product

RevenueHunt app is able to sync and recommend subscription products created with ReCharge Subscriptions for Shopify. Check [here](/how-to-guides/recommend-subscription-products/) for instructions on how to enable it.

For other subscription apps, there's a [workaround](/how-to-guides/recommend-subscription-products/#other-subscriptions) that allows you to still guide your customers towards subscription options via the RevenueHunt app.

# How to Ensure a Specific Product Always Appears on Your Results Page

This guide provides a clear, step-by-step process to making sure that specific products are always visible on the Results Page of your quiz, regardless of the customer's choices.

!!! warning "Understand the voting system first"

    The backbone of personalized product recommendations is an algorithm that functions like a [voting system](#how-to-recommend-products), where products gain 'votes' based on customer selections in a quiz. The more votes a product has by the end of the quiz, the more likely it is to be displayed on the Results Page. Familiarizing yourself with [this recommendation mechanism](#how-to-recommend-products) is essential for effectively implementing the strategies outlined below.

## Strategy 1: Link Your Product to Every Choice

This approach ensures your chosen product always tops the Results Page by securing the most votes.

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

1. Access the [Link Products](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) section of the Quiz Builder. 
    2. Link your selected product with **every choice** available in the quiz. This method guarantees that the product collects votes with each customer selection, ensuring its appearance on the Results Page.
    This strategy positions the product at the forefront of the Results Page every time.
    1. **Create a Collection/Category for Your Product(s)**: Group the products you wish to feature in a `New Products` collection/category. For instance, include your `Essentials Makeup Kit COMPLETE` in this collection.
    2. **Ensure Your Store Is Synced**: After creating your collection/category or adding new products, [sync the app](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/).
    3. **Link the Collection/Category to Quiz Responses**: Select a quiz question and link your new product or collection/category to **every response option**. This step is crucial as it ensures the product or collection/category receives at least one vote, guaranteeing its appearance on the Results Page regardless of quiz outcomes.
    4. **Add a Dedicated Slot on the Results Page**: Edit the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) to include a new `Product Slot` specifically for showcasing your selected product or collection/category. This specialized section will exclusively feature items from your chosen collection/category, distinguishing them from the general recommendations.
    5. **Link collection/category to slot**: Make sure to `include` the created collection/category in the `Product Slot`.
    6. **Preview and Test Your Setup**: With your dedicated slot in place, click the `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz. Then, preview the quiz and its results to ensure the new product or collection is displayed as intended. This final step confirms that your selected items are correctly highlighted on the Results Page.

# How to Ask for Marketing/Data Processing Consent

Directly asking for marketing consent or acceptance of data processing in your quiz can be a straightforward and efficient way to ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR.

This article outlines several methods to integrate consent requests seamlessly into your quizzes.

!!! note

    Check our latest article [Smart Ways to Ask for Marketing/Data Processing Consent in Your Product Recommendation Quiz](https://revenuehunt.com/smart-ways-to-ask-for-marketing-data-processing-consent-in-your-product-recommendation-quiz/) to learn more.

    </div>

## Add a Link to Your Privacy Policy

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

A fundamental step in asking for consent is to make your Privacy Policy easily accessible. You can link to your Privacy Policy within any text element of the quiz using [Markdown Language](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/). 
    For example, like this:
    ```markdown
    By providing your email address you agree to our [privacy policy](https://www.linktoyourprivacypolicy.com).
    ```
    ![how to consent privacy policy](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-14-122634.png)
    You can inform the customer in the question description that by providing the email address they agree to receive marketing information.
    1. To show question description go to the [quiz builder](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) select a question and open the [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).
    2. Enable the `question description` feature.
    3. A text field will appear where you can add your consent text.
    4. Include a link to your privacy policy using [Markdown Language](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/), e.g., `[privacy policy](https://www.linktoyourprivacypolicy.com)`
    5. Publish your changes using the `Publish` button located at the top-right corner.
    Create a marketing consent checkbox by combining quiz slides can ensure users actively consent before proceeding.
    1. Go to the [quiz builder](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) and place a `Multiple Choice` question right after the `email/phone` question slide.
    2. Add a single choice with your consent text, e.g., `I consent to process my data for marketing purposes.`
    3. Return to the `email/phone` question , access [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings), and enable the `join next question` option.
    4. This connects the two questions, requiring users to select the marketing consent option to proceed with the quiz.

# How to Change Checkout Settings on Your Results Page

Adjusting the checkout settings in RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz allows you to choose whether your customers will proceed to the cart, checkout or the product page from the results page. 

Follow the instructions below to change your checkout settings:

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/f2ddc47043904e48bb08cbadc6f24233?sid=2f93b324-dc00-42ff-89cf-bd759e0f3a44" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    1. **Access Results Page Settings**: Begin by navigating to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) tab in the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/). Here, you will find a clog icon indicating the [Results Page settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/). Click this icon to proceed.
    2. **Locate Checkout Settings**: Within the settings menu, navigate to the `Basic` section, and from there, find the `Checkout Settings`. 
        ![how to change checkout settings](/images/manual_quizbuilder_resultspage_settings_basic_checkout.png){width="500"}
    3. This is where you can customize how products are added to the cart and how customers proceed to checkout. RevenueHunt's Product Recommendation Quiz offers two primary options for managing how customers interact with products they wish to purchase:
        1. **Add Product to Cart**:
            ![how to change checkout settings add to cart](/images/how_to_change_checkout_settings_add_to_cart.png)
            - This option allows you to add selected products directly to the customer's shopping cart. It streamlines the buying process, making it easier for customers to proceed to checkout.
            - After enabling this option, you can further specify whether customers should:
                -  `proceed to cart` and be directed to the shopping cart page to review their selections or if they should
                - `proceed to checkout` and be taken directly to the checkout page, bypassing the cart. 
            This decision should align with your sales strategy and consideration of the customer's convenience.
        2. **Link to Product**:
            ![how to change checkout settings view product](/images/how_to_change_checkout_settings_view_product.png)
            - Alternatively, you might want customers to have the opportunity to view more details about a product before making a purchase. Selecting this option replaces the direct 'add to cart' action with a `view product` link.
            - When customers click on the `view product` link, they are taken to the individual product page instead of adding the item directly to their cart. This can be beneficial for providing customers with additional product information, images, and reviews that might influence their purchasing decision.
        3. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.

# How to Change Quiz Currency

This guide explains how to change the currency of your quiz and how to handle multi-currency setups based on Shopify Markets.

## Change the quiz currency

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

To change the quiz currency:
    1. Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/).
    2. Navigate to the [`Quiz Settings > General`](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#general) tab.
        ![manual_shopify_quizbuilder_quizsettings_general](/images/manual_quizbuilder_quizsettings_general.png){width="300"}
    3. Scroll down to the `Currency` field and click on the dropdown.
    4. Select your currency from the list.
    5. Update the preview/live quiz by clicking the `Publish` button in the top-right corner.
    !!! info
        If you're missing a currency from the list, please [contact support](/how-to-guides/contact-customer-support/).
    At the moment the RevenueHunt app doesn‚Äôt support multi-currency stores. We‚Äôre pulling your store‚Äôs **base currency**. Our app takes into account the original prices set up in your store. If your base currency is in USD dollars, then the US dollar prices will be the only ones synced with the app.
    If you run a multi-currency shop there's a workaround. What most customers do is show the product on the results page without the price and instead choose the checkout option to view the product. This way the customer is redirected to the product page from the result where the right price is applied.
    Follow these steps to apply this workaround:
    1. Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/).
    2. Navigate to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/).
    3. Open the [Results Page Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/).
    4. In [Basic Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#basic-settings), check the `Checkout Settings` section. Select `Link to product`.
    5. Scroll down to `Individual Product Settings`. 
    5. Search for `Show price` and click the toggle to deactivate it. 
    Now, the product price will not be shown and the customer will be redirected to the product page from the results page.

# How to Change the Language of Your Quiz

This guide will help you change the language of your quiz, translate it into different languages or set up Shopify Markets to display the quiz in different languages based on the visitor's location and language preference.

!!! tip "Tutorial"
    
    Check our step by step tutorial on how to set up Shopify Markets and assign quizzes to different markets and languages with the RevenueHunt app: [Assign Quizzes to Shopify Markets and Languages](/tutorials/shopify-markets/).

## Change Quiz Language in Settings

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

!!! note
        Version 1 of the RevenueHunt App for Shopify doesn't support the Shopify Markets feature. 
    1. **Open Quiz Settings**: To change the quiz language navigate to [Quiz Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/) or [`Quiz Settings -> Messages`](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#messages).
        ![how to change quiz language messages](/images/manual_quizbuilder_quizsettings_messages.png){width="300"}
    2. **Language**: Choose a language from a dropdown list to change the text on the quiz buttons and placeholders into that language.
    3. **Add your own translations**: If the desired language is not available or you prefer a different translation you can modify individual instances (such as buttons and placeholders) directly within the [Messages](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#messages) tab.
    4. **Override the translations**: Should any buttons revert to their original English translations (overriding your selected quiz language) you can manually adjust the button text in [`Quiz Builder -> Question settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).
    While our application currently lacks native multi-language support, there are effective workarounds to present quizzes in multiple languages.
    How does it work?
    - For now, it is possible to [create multiple quizzes](#step-1-create-quizzes-in-different-languages), each one in a different language. 
    - Then, each of these quizzes will have a **unique quiz ID**. 
    - You can embed each of these quizzes on a separate page on your store (eg quiz-en, quiz-de, quiz-fr‚Ä¶) or have your developer create a [script that displays the correct quiz](#step-2-display-the-correct-quiz-based-on-browser-language) popup depending on the browser language.
    - However, the main problem is that our app **can only sync the base products from your store (in the main language)**, as products translated automatically to other languages don't have unique product IDs that we could sync. So you can change the quiz language but the product names and descriptions will be shown in the original language. There are some [workarounds](#step-3-handling-product-sync-in-multilingual-stores) mentioned in the article that you can try.
    **Step 1: Create Quizzes in Different Languages**
    - **Manual Translation**: Begin by manually translating your quizzes into the desired languages. Each translated quiz will have a unique quiz ID.
    - **Quiz Settings Adjustment**: Navigate to the [Quiz Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/) to modify the language of interactive elements like buttons. However, note that questions and choices need manual translation.
    **Step 2: Display the Correct Quiz Based on Browser Language**
    Use JavaScript to show the appropriate quiz to users based on their browser's language setting. The script should:
    - Detect the browser's language.
    - Map this language to the corresponding quiz ID.
    - Update quiz links and iframes on your site to point to the correct quiz version.
    Script sample code:
    ```javascript
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
      // Check browser's preferred language (get the first two characters to ignore region)
      const language = navigator.language.substring(0,2);
      // Your mapping of languages to quiz IDs
      const quizMapping = {
        'en': 'abc123',
        'fr': 'dfg456',
        'de': 'xyz423'
      };
      // Default language (fallback to English if not found)
      const defaultQuizId = quizMapping[language] || quizMapping['en'];
      // Find all quiz links and update the href
      const quizLinks = document.querySelectorAll('a[href^="#quiz-"]');
      quizLinks.forEach(link => {
        link.setAttribute('href', '#quiz-' + defaultQuizId);
      });
      // Find all iframes with quiz URLs and update the src attribute and the data-url attribute of the parent div
      const quizIframes = document.querySelectorAll('iframe[src^="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/"]');
      quizIframes.forEach(iframe => {
        const newSrc = iframe.src.replace(/quiz\/\w+/, 'quiz/' + defaultQuizId);
        iframe.src = newSrc;
        // If the parent div has the data-url attribute, update it as well
        const parentDiv = iframe.parentElement;
        if (parentDiv && parentDiv.hasAttribute('data-url')) {
          const newDataUrl = parentDiv.getAttribute('data-url').replace(/quiz\/\w+/, 'quiz/' + defaultQuizId);
          parentDiv.setAttribute('data-url', newDataUrl);
        }
      });
    });
    ```
    !!! warning
        Make sure that you don‚Äôt publish two quizzes on the same page, as this may lead to unwanted behavior.
    **Step 3: Redirect to Translated Product URL**
    Our application syncs only the base products from your store. Products translated into other languages won't have unique IDs for sync. Although you can change the quiz language, product names and descriptions will be displayed in the original language. 
    A workaround for this could be creating quizzes in different languages and redirecting users to the translated product pages with [JavaScript](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/).
    1. Instead of adding a product to cart, you can change the [checkout settings](/how-to-guides/change-checkout-settings/) to `link to product` and point customers to the translated product page.
    2. By default, the customer will be redirected to the original product URL, but you can force an automatic URL change via JavaScript. 
    3. For example, you can tell the Results Page to automatically change all the links from this `https://www.example.com/products/productA` to this `https://www.example.com/en/products/productA` This way your customers will be automatically redirected to the translated product page.
    4. To redirect to an English translation of a product, one can use:
            ```javascript
            let shopURL = "https://www.example.com";
            var links = document.querySelectorAll(".lq-product a");
            for (let i = 0; i < links.length; i++) {
            var href = links[i].href;
            links[i].href = href.replace(shopURL,shopURL+"/en");
            }
            ```
    5. Make sure to replace the `https://www.example.com` with your store URL and change the `shopURL+"/en"` to the language code you have set up in your store (for example, `shopURL+"/fr"` for French).

# How to Check Quiz Loading Speed

When integrating a quiz into your online store, it's crucial to ensure it loads efficiently to maintain a smooth user experience. If you're encountering slow loading times for your quiz, the issue might not stem from the quiz itself but from other resources on your site affecting its performance. 

This guide outlines steps to diagnose and resolve quiz loading issues by optimizing the loading process.

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

**Step 1: Verify Direct Quiz Link Performance**
    First, isolate the quiz from your site's environment to determine if the issue lies within the quiz or your website.
    1. **Locate Your Quiz Link**: Find the direct URL of your quiz. This can be obtained from the `Share -> External` tab of your quiz platform. 
        - The link should look something like [https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/rkHm6Y](https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/rkHm6Y) or [https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/#quiz-rkHm6Y](https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/#quiz-rkHm6Y), where `rkHm6Y` represents your unique `quiz ID`.
    2. **Test Loading Speed**: Open the direct link in a browser to see how quickly the quiz loads independently of your site. Ideally, the quiz should load in less than one second.
    If the quiz loads quickly via the direct link, the slow loading times are likely caused by other elements on your website.
    !!! tip
        Try [https://pagespeed.web.dev/](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to check the direct quiz link performance.
    ---
    **Step 2: Analyze Your Website's Loading Order**
    Investigating the loading sequence of your website's resources can help identify what's slowing down the quiz when embedded in your site.
    1. **Open Developer Tools**: Right-click on your website in the browser and select `Inspect` to open the developer tools.
    2. **Review Network and Performance**: Navigate to the `Network` or `Performance` tabs to examine which resources are loading and how long each takes.
    Look for resources that significantly delay loading times, as these are likely culprits affecting the quiz's performance on your site.
    !!! tip
        Try [https://pagespeed.web.dev/](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to check the quiz page performance.
    ---
    **Step 3: Try Direct iFrame Embedding**
    To circumvent slow loading caused by external scripts, directly embed the quiz using an iFrame.
    **Replace Embed Code**: Instead of using the standard embed code generated from the `Share` tab, which loads the quiz via a JavaScript file (embed.js), use an iFrame embed code. This allows the quiz to load independently of other scripts on your site.
    Replace this code:
    ```html
    <div class="rh-widget rh-inline" data-url="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/rkHm6Y" style="..."></div>
    ```
    With this:
    ```html
    <div class="rh-inline" data-url="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/rkHm6Y" style="..."><iframe src="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/rkHm6Y" id="DPIyZ" style="..."></iframe></div>
    ```
    This second block of code includes the quiz iFrame directly. This will start rendering the quiz before the embed.js code is loaded.
    ---
    **Step 4: Optimize Your Website's Resources**
    Consult your developer to review and optimize the loading of resources on your site. This may involve compressing images, minimizing CSS and JavaScript files, and removing unnecessary plugins or widgets.

# How to Copy the Quiz from One Store to Another

Transferring a quiz from one store to another with the RevenueHunt app is straightforward. This process allows you to duplicate your quiz design, questions, tags, and the results page, however, **products and collections will not be transferred** due to differing product IDs in the new store.

!!! warning
    Before you begin, ensure the [RevenueHunt app](https://revenuehunt.com/product-recommendation-quiz-shopify/) is installed on both the original and the new store.


!!! warning

    It is not possible to copy a quiz created with the legacy version of the RevenueHunt app into the new Built for Shopify version of the app.

This article will guide you through the process of copying a quiz from one store to another.

## Copying the Quiz

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/647ee0682820461a8719451d389b8990?sid=17c277e8-4356-458d-bd1a-9e45e370c23c" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    **Step 1: Generate Export Quiz Code**
    First, navigate to the quiz you wish to export:
    1. Go to [Quiz Settings > General](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#general).
    2. Click on **Export quiz to another store**. A popup will display a unique code.
    3. **Copy this code** immediately. It remains valid for only 1 hour.
        ![Export Quiz Step](/images/how_to_copy_the_quiz_step_1_v2.gif)
        !!! tip
            To prevent loss, save the export quiz code in a text file.
    **Step 2: Log in to the Other Store**
    Ensure you're logged into the destination store:
    1. Log in to the new store's Shopify account in an Incognito/Private browsing mode. This way you can avoid being logged into multiple accounts on the same browser and prevent caching issues.
    2. Open the RevenueHunt app from the store's dashboard.
    **Step 3: Import the Quiz**
    Finally, import the quiz into your new store:
    1. In the RevenueHunt app, navigate to the [Dashboard](/reference/dashboard/).
    2. Click on the [New Quiz](/reference/dashboard/#new-quiz) option.
    3. Choose **import a quiz from another store** and paste the previously generated code.
        ![Import Quiz Step](/images/how_to_copy_the_quiz_step_3.gif)
    After completing these steps, the imported quiz will appear in your dashboard with a `(copy)` suffix in its name.
    If you‚Äôre only changing the domain name (from `example.com` to `example-two.com`) and NOT changing the Shopify account (aka `.myshopify.com` address) the process shouldn‚Äôt disturb the RevenueHunt app and your quizzes. You can do so safely.
    If you‚Äôre changing the `.myshopify` account, then check [this guide](#how-to-copy-the-quiz-from-one-store-to-another) to copy the quiz from one store to another. After the quiz is copied, you may need to link your products to choices again, as they will have different product IDs in your new store. Make sure you‚Äôre **not** logged into two Shopify accounts at the same time on the same browser. This may cause caching issues. Instead, use Incognito / Private browsing for the second account.

    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UMCpGlbjrUA?si=i8qBdRW2V0RQdLHx" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
    1. **Add new quiz**: Go to the app‚Äôs [dashboard](/reference/dashboard/) and click [`+ new quiz`](/reference/dashboard/#new-quiz).
    2. **Choose a template**: Choose a pre-defined template or start from scratch.
    3. **Name your quiz**: The name can be edited later.
    4. **Redirect to Quiz Builder**: After that, you'll be redirected to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/).
    In [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) you'll be able to add questions to your quiz.
    1. **Add slides**: To add a question, click the `+` button or hover over an existing question and click the `+ new question` button. Select a [question type](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-types) from the dropdown.
    2. **Delete slides**: To delete a question, click the `.../more options` button (three dots) and select **Delete/Remove**.
    Once you have your questions, you'll have to link products to choices to show recommendations to the customer.
    1. **Go to Link Products/Collections/Choice Settings tab**: In the Quiz Builder, select a choice and go to [Link Products](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/)/ [Link Collections](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/) / [Choice Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings) tab.
    2. **Upvote Products**: Link product variants or collections to each choice. This determines the product recommendations based on customer responses. In the end, the Results Page will display the products sorted by the number of votes.
    3. **Edit the Results Page**: Go to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) tab and edit the content. You can change the number of recommended products in the [Product Block settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings).
    ??? question "How do I get the right recommendations?"
        Our product recommendation algorithm works like a voting system:
        - Products are linked to each choice
        - When a customer picks a choice, all linked products receive one vote
        - After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted products sorted by the number of votes
        - If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty
        - If there's a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the order of products.
        If you want to make the results ultra-precise, you can also:
        - Limit the recommendations to only show products that received X votes or more in the [Results Page settings](/how-to-guides/only-recommend-products-with-minimum-votes/).
        - Use [Exclusions](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/#understanding-inclusion-and-exclusion) to make sure that unwanted products are not shown (even if they were upvoted in another choice earlier).
    Read more about how the recommendations work [here](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/).
    To test the quiz, you'll have to save the changes and preview it.
    1. **Publish the changes**: Click [`Publish`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) on the top-right menu. Don't worry, clicking `Publish` will not automatically add the quiz to your website. It will simply save the changes and allow you to preview the quiz.
    2. **Preview the quiz**: Click [`Preview`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) to test the quiz you've created. 
        !!! tip    
            You can test the quiz as much as you like as long as you always open a new preview window. These test responses done as admin are automatically removed after 1 hour to not add to your usage quota.
    Once you're satisfied with your quiz, you can put it on your website. 
    1. **Publish the quiz**: Follow this guide on [How to Publish the Quiz on Your Website](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz/) to learn about different ways the quiz can be added.
    If changes are made post-publishing, click `Publish` again to update the live quiz.

        ```
        will change the color of all the paragraphs in the quiz to red.
        ```html
        #question-AbC7Zde  p {color: red;}
        ```
        will change the color of a paragraph to red ONLY for question `AbC7Zde`, where `AbC7Zde` is the question ID. You can find a specific question ID in Quiz Builder > [Question setttings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).

            !!! example "Example: Google Font Code"
                ```html
                @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Quicksand&display=swap');
                .quicksand-font {
                font-family: "Quicksand", serif;
                font-optical-sizing: auto;
                font-weight: 400;
                font-style: normal;
                }
                h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, button, div{
                font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif ;
                }
                ```

    !!! info "With custom JavaScript, you can:"
        - add custom behavior, images, texts or logic
        - change quiz layout
        - display custom product recommendations
        - forward to any particular page on your store
        - add tracking codes to specific questions (Google Analytics, Meta Pixel)
    Check out the [How to Add JavaScript to the Quiz](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) guide for more details on how to add custom JavaScript to the quiz.
    You can use [Markdown Language](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/) for basic styling of text in the quiz. 
    ??? question "What is Markdown Languge?"
        Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters, like `#` or `*`.
    If you need to include additional styling and elements in your questions, choices, and results page, you can do so using Markdown Language.
    - **Headings**
        ```html
        # H1
        ## H2
        ### H3
        ```
    - **Text Styling**
        ```html
        *italic text*  
        **bold text**  
        ***italic & bold text***  
        ```
    - **Links**
        ```html
        [link title](https://www.example.com)
        ```
    - **Images**
        ```html
        ![alt text](https://www.example.com/path/to/image.jpg)
        ```
    - **Videos**
        ```html
        ![](https://youtu.be/0_tO8HgJiLQ)  
        ```
    If you want to change the font or the color of certain texts or whole paragraphs, you may need to use [Custom CSS](#add-custom-css-code) code for that. 
    You can add images to your quiz in serveral ways. 
    - **Upload images/videos via question settings**: You can add a unique image to every question through the Quiz Builder by accessing the [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).
    - **Embed images/videos via Markdown Language**: You can embed unique ijmages or videos into text blocks in your question description or the results page with Markdown language.
        - Images:
        ```html
        ![alt text](https://www.example.com/path/to/image.jpg)
        ```
        - Videos
        ```html
        ![](https://youtu.be/0_tO8HgJiLQ)  
        ```
    !!! tip
        Check this guide to learn how to add and optimize your images for the quiz: [How to Add/Adjust Images](/how-to-guides/add-adjust-images/).
    In addition to the overall Quiz Design options, you can add a unique image to every question through the Quiz Builder by accessing the [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).
    ![manual_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_questionsettings_sidemenu](/images/manual_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_questionsettings_sidemenu.png){width="500"}
    The question settings also allow you to incorporate [custom JavaScript](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) into your quiz design.
    Here are a few popular CSS selectors and codes to style elements in the quiz:
    ??? example "Hide Progress Bar in the footer"
        ```html
        /* Hide Progress Bar in the footer */
        .lq-progress-box{
        display: none;
        }
        ```
    ??? example "Change the styles of the choices"
        ```html
        /* Change the styles of the choices */
        li.lq-choice, li.lq-choice{
        /* your CSS rules go here */
        }
        ```
    ??? example "Change the styles of the picture choices"
        ```html
        .lq-images li.lq-choice, .lq-images li.lq-choice{
        /* your CSS rules go here */
        }
        ```
    ??? example "Place the footer bar at the top, for more visibility"
        ```html
        .lq-footer, .lq-footer{
        position: absolute;
        width: 100%;
        top: 0;
        margin: 0;
        }
        ```
    ??? example "Make 'Back' and 'Next' arrows point left and right"
        ```html
        #nav-next .fa, #nav-back .fa {
            -webkit-transform: rotate(-90deg);
            -moz-transform: rotate(-90deg);
            -o-transform: rotate(-90deg);
            -ms-transform: rotate(-90deg);
            transform: rotate(-90deg);
        }
        ```
    ??? example "Adding a custom font"
        Adding a custom font (you'll have to host the font in your server). If your fonts are hosted within your Shopify store, they' may appear as a "private" fonts or hosted within a site restricted for us. If you want to use that font it'd have to be hosted elsewhere, and that way you could implement them within the quiz. Alternatively, check [Upload Google Font](#upload-a-google-font).
        ```html
        @font-face {
        font-family: "Morion";
        src: url("https://yourwebsite.com/wp-content/themes/yourtheme/fonts/Morion-Light.woff2") format("woff2");
        );
        }

        font-family: Morion, serif;
        }
        ```

        ```html
        /*Hide the "add all to cart" button */
        .lq-checkout.lq-add-all-to-cart {
            display: none;
        }
        ```
    ??? example "Hide the product variants"
        ```html
        /* this hides the product variants */
        .no-variants-dropdown {
        display: none;

        .lq-variants-dropdown {

        .lq-results .el-input, .lq-results .el-input__inner {
        display: none;
        }
        ```
    ??? example "Adds quiz border"
        ```html
        /* Adds quiz border */

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 53.125%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CZtWnLzw-Ko?si=XEqVrLMGlNSF7rl2" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    ![manual_quizbuilder_resultspage](/images/manual_quizbuilder_resultspage.png)
    1. **Plan Your Page Layout**: Decide on a mix of static and dynamic blocks to provide both consistent and personalized content.
    2. **Add Blocks**: Insert [building blocks](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#block-types) such as Heading, Content, HTML, Image, Products List, and Products Slots Blocks as needed.
    3. **Configure the Block**: Adjust [block settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) or ,for dynamic elements, use the `@` symbol for [information recalls](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) or set [Display Logic](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/) for conditional visibility.
    4. **Adjust Page Settings**: Tailor the checkout process, product reviews visibility, and manage out-of-stock and duplicate product recommendations under [Basic Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#basic-settings). Use [Advanced Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#advanced-settings) for further customization with [JavaScript](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) and [product metafields](/how-to-guides/add-product-metafields/).
    5. **Review and Test**: Click the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz. Ensure the Results Page reflects your quiz's purpose and functions as intended, providing a seamless and personalized user experience.

# How to Filter Recommendations by Price

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/66ade08895f5478d80b2f686576642ad?sid=da3831fd-a490-4ba8-aab6-cb05bd873001" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    This guide explains how to filter recommendations by price in your quiz results page. 
    It explains how to implement a price filtering feature in a quiz using Shopify and the Revenue Hunt Quizzes app. It covers the steps to create collections based on price ranges and how to configure the quiz to filter product recommendations accordingly.
    1. **Adding a Price Filtering Question**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/). Click `+` to add a new multiple choice question titled "What's your desired price range for your skincare routine?". Provide a price range for each option. Save the changes to ensure the question is added.
        !!! example "Price Filtering Question"
            Provide three options: 
            - Under 20 euros
            - Between 20 and 50 euros
            - Over 50 euros
            ![filter by price example](/images/how_to_filter_by_price_filter_legacy_question_example.png)
    2. **Creating Price-Based Collections in Shopify** : Go to Shopify, then `Products > Collections`.
        - Click `Add collection` to create a new collection for products.
        - Name the collection (for example, Under 20 euros) and choose to create a **smart** collection with the condition. 
            !!! example "Sample Smart Collection Conditions"
                For example, `Price` `is less than` `20 euros`.
                or `Price` `is greater than` `50 euros`.
                or `Price` `is between` `20 euros` and `50 euros`.
                ![filter by price example](/images/how_to_filter_by_price_smart_collection_example.png)
        - Save the collection.
        - Repeat the process to create: 
            - A collection for products between 20 and 50 euros (Price `> 20` and Price `< 50`).
            - A collection for products over 50 euros (Price `> 50`).
        - Save each collection after setting the conditions.
    3. **Catalog Sync**: Run the [catalog sync](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/) from the success checklist to import new collections. After syncing, refresh the quiz page.
    4. **Configuring the Quiz to Filter Recommendations**: Return to the Revenue Hunt Quizzes app and open your quiz. Open the [Link Collections](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/) section. Find the `Upvotes` section and upvote and exclude the collections for each price range.
        !!! example "Configuring the Quiz to Filter Recommendations"
            - For the 'Under 20 euros' choice: Upvote the collection for products under 20 euros. Exclude collections for products between 20 and 50 euros and over 50 euros.
            - For the '20 to 50 euros' choice: Upvote the collection for products between 20 and 50 euros. Exclude collections for products under 20 euros and over 50 euros.
            - For the 'Over 50 euros' choice: Upvote the collection for products over 50 euros. Exclude collections for products under 20 euros and between 20 and 50 euros.
            ![filter by collection example](/images/how_to_filter_by_price__legacy_filter_question_linkedcollections.png)
    4. **Testing the Price Filter Functionality**: Preview the quiz to test the filtering functionality. Select the option for products over 50 euros to verify that only those products are displayed. Repeat the test for the other price ranges to ensure accurate filtering. Confirm that the recommendations reflect the selected price range correctly.
        !!! tip "Troubleshooting"
            Check the [Response Analysis](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#response-analysis) tool in case of wrong recommendations.
            It may also be necessary to run a quick [catalog sync](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/) in case of wrong recommendations.

# Fixing Viewport Issue on Mobile

## Introduction

This guide addresses a common issue where the form on mobile devices is not fixed and moves from side to side, causing a poor user experience. This problem can be resolved by adjusting the meta viewport tag in the store's HTML.

## Problem Description

Users have reported that on mobile devices, the form page slightly zooms in when focusing on a text input, causing the page to move from left to right and resulting in a poor user experience. This issue needs to be addressed to ensure the form remains fixed on mobile devices.

## Solution

To fix this issue, the developer needs to modify the meta viewport tag in the store's HTML. The tag should include `maximum-scale=1.0` and `user-scalable=0` to prevent the page from moving.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. Locate the meta viewport tag in the HTML of your store. It might look like this:

   ```html
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0">
   ```

2. Modify the tag to include `maximum-scale=1.0` and `user-scalable=0`:

   ```html
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0">
   ```

3. If the meta viewport tag is missing, add the modified tag to the `<head>` section of your HTML.

![Fix viewport issue mobile](/images/fix_viewport_issue_mobile.png)

## Testing

After making these changes, test the form on a mobile device to ensure it remains fixed and does not move from side to side.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the changes are applied to the correct HTML file in your store.
- If you encounter any issues, consider reaching out to your web developer for assistance.

## Platform-Specific Instructions

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

1. Log in to your Shopify admin panel.
    2. Go to **Online Store** > **Themes**.
    3. Click on **Actions** next to your current theme and select **Edit code**.
    4. In the **Layout** section, find and open the `theme.liquid` file.
    5. Locate the `<head>` section in this file to modify the meta viewport tag.

# How to Show or Hide Content Based on Quiz Answers

In this article, you‚Äôll discover how to use `IF-THEN` conditional logic to hide or show certain questions or sections based on customer answers to quiz questions. This includes conditionally hiding certain questions or statements within your quiz using [Jump Logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/) or [Skip Logic](/how-to-guides/use-skip-logic/) and showing or hiding blocks/sections on the Results page with [Display Logic](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/).

Using a skincare routine quiz as an example, we'll show how custom text and result can be displayed based on the customer‚Äôs skin type.

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

<div class="videoWrapper">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mYejhkIPYTI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HfYhbWB21Qg?si=gdRcqMWV35IOV0QA" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    ![how to hide content with logic jump logic](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_jump_logic.png)
    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add a `Multiple choice question` asking the customer about their skin type: Dry, Normal, Oily, or Combination-type skin. 
        !!! tip
            Use the description box in `Question Settings -> Show Description` to help customers determine their skin type.
    2. **Create Statement Questions**: Add multiple `Statement` slides describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:
        !!! example
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness ‚Äì we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that‚Äôs deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn‚Äôt experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin‚Äôs natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
    3. **Add Jump Logic**: If we don‚Äôt add jump logic to the quiz, our statement questions will just appear one after the other, regardless of the choice we made. To add jump logic, you should go back to the skin type question and select [conditional logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/). Set up `IF-THEN` statements with `OR` logic to direct the customer to the correct text based on their skin type. 
        ![how to hide content with logic jump logic statement](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_jump_logic_statement.png)
    4. **Add "Always Jump to..." Logic**: Once all the statements are linked with logic to the skin type question, you should point each statement to the next question in the quiz. This is done by going to the [jump logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/) tab and scrolling toward the `Always jump to...` section. Point each statement to the next question.
    4. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVAg0KfkX5Q?si=tBJo7gXHs4dvRTn1" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add a `Multiple choice question` asking the customer about their skin type: Dry, Normal, Oily, or Combination-type skin. 
        !!! tip
            Use the description box in `Question Settings -> Show Description` to help customers determine their skin type.
    2. **Add Content Blocks to Results Page**: Go to the Results Page and add a new `content block`. To add a content block click the `+` sign and select `Content Block` from the list. Add multiple content blocks describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:
        !!! example
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness ‚Äì we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that‚Äôs deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn‚Äôt experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin‚Äôs natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
        !!! tip    
            Make the heading stand out with [markdown language](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/). Use the`#` sign before a sentence can make it bold.
    3. **Add Display Logic**: If we don‚Äôt add [Display Logic](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/) to the quiz, our blocks will just appear one after the other on the Results Page, regardless of the choice we made. To add Display Logic, select a content block and click on `display logic`. Next, click `add display logic`. Set up IF-THEN statements to control when each content block should be visible or hidden based on the customer's choices.
        ![how to hide content with logic display logic statement](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_display_logic_statement.png)
    4. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHYDwwTIuWg?si=pRhc-juq4lgIsIw2" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    ![how to hide content with logic skip logic](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_skip_logic.png)
    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add a `Multiple choice question` asking the customer about their skin type: Dry, Normal, Oily, or Combination-type skin. 
        !!! tip
            Use the description box in `Question Settings -> Show Description` to help customers determine their skin type.
    2. **Create Statement Questions**: Add multiple `Statement` slides describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:
        !!! example
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness ‚Äì we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that‚Äôs deeply nourishing and hydrating.

            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
    3. **Add Skip Logic**: If we don‚Äôt add skip logic to the quiz, our statement questions will just appear one after the other, regardless of the choice we made. To add [skip logic](/how-to-guides/use-skip-logic/), you should go back to the skin type question and select `conditional logic`. Next, you should navigate to the `Skip Logic` section and add a skip logic rule to each statement. Use skip logic to ensure that only relevant statement questions appear based on the customer's skin type selection.
        ![how to hide content with logic skip logic statement](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_skip_logic_statement.png)
    4. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.

    1. **Understand the Callback Function**: Visit the [FAQ page](/how-to-guides/use-callback-function/) to learn how our callback function works and how it can be used for tracking custom events.
    2. **Embed the Custom Script**: Add the following script to your store's theme where the quiz is featured (preferably sitewide in your theme's main template file):
        ```html
        <script>
        function prqQuizCallback(quizResponse){
            gtag('event', 'your_event_name', {
            'event_category': 'quiz',
            'event_label': 'specific_label',
            'value': quizResponse.someValue
            });
        }
        </script>
        ``` 
    3. **Customize Event Tracking**: Modify the script with appropriate event names, labels, and values to track specific user actions. For example:
        ```html
        <script>
        function prqQuizCallback(quizResponse){
            // Track quiz start
            if(quizResponse.type === 'quiz_started') {
                gtag('event', 'quiz_start', {
                    'event_category': 'quiz',
                    'event_label': quizResponse.quizName
                });
            }
            // Track question answers
            if(quizResponse.type === 'question_answered') {
                gtag('event', 'question_answer', {
                    'event_category': 'quiz',
                    'event_label': quizResponse.questionTitle,
                    'value': quizResponse.answer
                });
            }
            // Track quiz completion
            if(quizResponse.type === 'quiz_completed') {
                gtag('event', 'quiz_complete', {
                    'event_category': 'quiz',
                    'event_label': quizResponse.quizName
                });
            }
        }
        </script>
        ```
    4. **Monitor and Adjust**: Once implemented, regularly check your Google Analytics dashboard to ensure events are being tracked correctly. Adjust the tracking code as needed based on your specific requirements.
    Once set up, you'll be able to see customer events in your Google Analytics dashboard, under `Reports > View user engagement and retention > Events`.
    ![how to ga events](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_events.png)
    If you're not seeing the events, please double-check the code you've added to the page where the quiz is embeded. 
    Depending on the custom events that you've programed in the [first step](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/#connect-the-quiz-to-google-analytics), you may be able to see quiz revenue in your Google Analytics.
    Refer to the Google Analytics [documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9216061?hl=en) for more information on how to track revenue from custom events or expolre the GA4 [Explorations](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7579450?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article).
    Google Analytics 4 (GA4) offers **Explorations**, a powerful tool for digging deeper into your quiz data. Standard reports show you high-level trends, but Explorations let you ask more specific questions about how customers interact with your quiz and how it impacts revenue.
    With Explorations, you can:
    - **Compare quiz users vs. all users**. See how much revenue is generated by customers who start a quiz compared to those who don‚Äôt.
    - **Break down results by quiz**. If you run multiple quizzes, use Explorations to see which quiz names bring in the most purchases and revenue.
    - **Build funnels**. Visualize the full journey from *quiz\_started* ‚Üí *results\_page\_viewed* ‚Üí *product\_added\_to\_cart* ‚Üí *purchase*, and spot where users drop off.
    - **Analyze user paths**. Discover what customers do after completing your quiz‚Äîdo they view recommended products, add to cart, or head straight to checkout?
    - **Create segments and audiences**. Build an audience of ‚ÄúQuiz Users‚Äù for ongoing analysis or remarketing in Google Ads.
    Refer to the Google Analytics [documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7579450?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article) for more information on how to use GA4 Explorations.

# How to Integrate Meta Pixel with Quiz

The Meta Pixel is an essential analytics tool for tracking user interaction with your quiz and gauging the success of your Facebook ads.

This article explains how to integrate the Meta Pixel with your quiz application and how to use the Meta Events Manager to track user interactions with your quiz.

??? question "What is Meta Pixel?"

    This small piece of code placed on your website helps you monitor conversions from ads, improve the performance of future advertising, and create targeted audiences based on past interactions with your website.

## Setting Up Your Meta Pixel

!!! note

    Facebook Pixel / Meta Pixel tracking works best if you embed your quiz on a new page in your online store. Follow the instuctions in [this article](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-inline/#embedding-an-inline-quiz-on-a-new-page) to set this up.

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

If you have not implemented a Pixel on your website yet, set one up following [Meta guide](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/952192354843755?id=1205376682832142). Once created, add it to your website.
    1. **Connect Meta Pixel to your Shopify Store**: Navigate to your Shopify `Store settings > Customer events`. Ensure that the Meta (Facebook) Pixel is integrated. If not, use the [Facebook and Instagram Meta app](https://apps.shopify.com/facebook) for integration.
    2. **Set Up Data Sources**: Open the Facebook and Instagram app in Shopify. Go to `settings` and set `shared data` to `maximum` to track advanced and custom events. Choose or create a **data set** for tracking. 
        ![how to integrate fb pixel built for shopify revenuehunt app](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_integrate_meta_pixel_facebookappsettings.png)
        !!! tip
            To create a new data set with a unique Pixel ID, go to [https://business.facebook.com/](https://business.facebook.com/) > `Ads Manager` > `Events Manager` > `Data sources` > `Create data source`.
    3. **Publish the Quiz**: Ensure the quiz is published on your online store. It is recommended to have a dedicated page for the quiz to track events accurately.
        !!! tip
            Check this article to learn how to publish the quiz on a dedicated landing page: [Publish Quiz Inline](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-inline/#embedding-an-inline-quiz-on-a-new-page)
    4. **Connect Quiz to Meta Pixel**: To integrate the Meta Pixel with your quiz:
        1. Go to the [Connect](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab within your quiz settings.
        2. Find the Meta Pixel section and hit `connect`.
        3. Enter your unique `Meta Pixel ID`. Make sure that this pixel ID is the same as the one you used to set up the data set in the Facebook and Instagram app.
    5. **Test the Integration**: In Shopify admin, go to Facebook and Instagram app > `settings`, and open the data set to access Meta Events Manager. Use the `Test events` feature to confirm that events are being tracked correctly by interacting with the quiz. Provide your website URL to test the integration. Then navigate to your website and interact with the quiz. After completing the quiz, check the Events Manager for tracked events such as: 
        - Retake quiz
        - View content page
        - Lead submissions (name and email)
        If events are visible, the pixel integration is functioning correctly.
        ![how to integrate fb pixel built for shopify revenuehunt app](https://loom.com/i/da1d0cdd420341698d56384c34496a99?workflows_screenshot=true)  
        For a complete list of tracked events within the Revenue Hunt app, check the [Tracked Events](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/#tracked-events) section.
    6. **Review Custom Events**: If you want to use the custom events in your ads and audiences, you need to review them. Check the [Review Custom Events](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/#review-custom-events) section.
    For an alternative approach to tracking user interactions, consider implementing custom JavaScript to measure specific events on your site. By incorporating our [callback function](/how-to-guides/use-callback-function/), you have the capability to manually trigger or log events based on user actions.
    To deploy this method, you can insert a script within the theme of your store's page, especially where a quiz is featured. Follow these steps:
    1. **Deactivate Meta Pixel**: If you have previously connected a pixel through the [Connect](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab, you'll have to deactivate it and publish the changes.
    2. **Understand the Callback Function**: Visit the [FAQ page](/how-to-guides/use-callback-function/) on custom integrations to learn how our callback function operates and how it can be utilized for tracking custom events.
    3. **Embed the Custom Script**: Insert the following script into the theme of your store‚Äôs page where the quiz or the event you want to track is located (load it sitewide and put it into the theme.liquid):
        ```html
        <script>
        function prqQuizCallback(quizResponse){
            window.fbq(action, event, params);
        }
        </script>
        ```
    4. **Customize Your Event Tracking**: In the script, replace the values with the appropriate event name, action, and params that you wish to track. This customization allows you to monitor specific user actions on your website.
    5. **Monitor and Adjust**: After the script is active and events are being tracked, regularly monitor the data to ensure everything is working as intended. Be prepared to make adjustments to the script or event definitions as needed.

# How to Display Multiple Questions per Slide in Your Quiz

This guide will walk you through the process of combining questions into a single slide using the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/).

The ability to display multiple questions on a single slide can help reduce the overall length of your quiz and keep participants engaged. 

To combine two or more questions into one slide, follow these steps:

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/651d6cb1573c4a53981b971cf9eefaa6?sid=b1ca7d15-e169-4acb-87b4-c994a0146c8b" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    1. **Add Your Questions**: First, ensure that you have your questions ready in your Product Recommendation Quiz. Adding questions is the preliminary step before you can begin merging them into a single slide.
    2. **Open Question Settings**: Click on the first question (the one you wish to appear at the top of the slide) to select it, then click on the wrench icon to open the [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).
    3. **Join Next Question**: Within the question settings menu, look for the option labeled `Join next question` and activate it.
        ![how to join slides setting](/images/how_to_join_slides_setting.png)
        Once activated, the selected question will automatically merge with the next one, displaying both on the same slide.
    4. **Merge Additional Questions**: If you wish to merge more than two questions you can continue the process.
    5. **Select the Joined Questions:** Click on the last question of the already merged set.
    6. **Repeat the Join Process:** Activate the `Join next question` option again. You can repeat this process to combine as many questions as you like, creating a comprehensive slide that houses multiple queries.

# How to Fix Product Images Not Showing

This guide explains how to fix product images not showing in your quiz.

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

Product or Collection images are displayed directly from your Shopify catalog. If you don't see product images, please check your Shopify Products/Collections.

================================================================================

# How to Only Recommend Products with X Votes or More

It is possible to limit the number of recommended products on the results page by only showing products that received X votes or more (a certain minimum number of votes). This allows you to filter the quiz recommendations and only show the real winners. 

To activate this setting in your quiz follow the instructions below.

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

1. Make sure that you have a **Product Block** or a **Product Slot Block** that recommends products on your [results page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/). 
    2. Make sure you understand how our [recommendations algorithm](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/) works.
        ??? question "How do I get the right recommendations?"
            Our product recommendation algorithm works like a voting system:
            - Products are linked to each choice
            - When a customer picks a choice, all linked products receive one vote
            - After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted products sorted by the number of votes
            - If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty
            - If there's a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the order of products.
    2. To activate the `Minimum nuber of votes` setting navigate to the [Results Page settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/).
    2. Open the [Advanced Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#advanced-settings).
    3. Scroll down to find the `Minimum number of votes` setting and activate it by clicking the toggle.
        ![how to only recommend product with min votes results page settings](/images/how_to_only_recommend_product_with_min_votes_results_page_settings.png)
    4. Once this option is active, the **Products Block** (or a **Slots Block**) on your results page will show extra setting in the [Block Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings). 
    5. Open the [Product/Slot Block settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) and find the `Min. Number of Votes`. 
    6. Click on a dropdown and select a number. You can change the number of minumun votes to the number that fits your quiz setup. 
        ![how_to_only_recommend_product_with_min_votes_block_settings.png](/images/how_to_only_recommend_product_with_min_votes_block_settings.png)
        !!! example
            For example, if you have 4 questions in your quiz and you select 4 as a min. number of votes, only products that receive **4 votes or more** (aka match the answers in all questions) will be shown. If a product receives 3 votes, it will not be shown. If a product receives 5 votes it will be shown.
    7. Update the preview/live quiz with these new settings by clicking `Publish` in the top-right corner.
    From now on, only products that receive this minimum number of votes will show up as a recommendation on the results page.
    !!! warning
        The Minimum number of votes setting is only available if you choose not to recommend products when results are empty in the [Results Page Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#advanced-settings) > Advanced > `Recommendation Settings`.
        ![how to only recommend product with min votes show random products](/images/how_to_only_recommend_product_with_min_votes_show_random_products.png)

# How to Pass Parameters to Pre-fill Quiz Responses

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

With RevenueHunt app you have the possibility to pre-fill the responses to certain questions in your quiz. 
    - This comes in very handy when users are logged in to your store and don‚Äôt want to ask them for the information you already have about them (eg. their name and email).
    - Another use case is when you‚Äôre driving traffic to your quiz from a mailing list and, again, you don‚Äôt want to ask them for their contact details.
    This feature can be implemented in two ways:
    - either declaring JavaScript variables in your store‚Äôs source code (note: developer needed)
    - passing URL parameters on a link to your store.
    You can declare `window.prq_vars` inside a JavaScript `<script>` tag in your store‚Äôs source code:
    ```html
    <script>
    window.prq_vars = {};
    window.prq_vars.name = 'John Doe';
    window.prq_vars.email = 'john.doe@gmail.com';
    window.prq_vars.phone = '+15556219645';
    window.prq_vars.cdRDCc = 'xDAwDe;aSEfBq';
    // question ID - choices IDs separated by ;
    </script>
    ```
    ### Example
    **Use case**: You‚Äôve embedded the quiz on all product pages and want to know from which product page the quiz was taken.
    **Solution**: You can pass parameters to the quiz (eg. product ID) and ‚Äústore‚Äù them in a question as a pre-filled answer.
    1. You will first need to create a `Short Text` question to store the product ID. Check how to add this question [here](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-types).
    2. Copy that question ID from [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).
    3. Then in your main product page include the following script, so you can add some script like this to your product page:
    ```html
    <script>
    window.prq_vars = {}; 
    window.prq_vars.questionID = 'productID';
    </script>
    ```
    That question will be automatically skipped if parameters have been passed, but note that if you use the quiz outside your product page you will need to also pass some ‚Äúempty‚Äù parameter to that questionID otherwise it will be shown in the quiz.
    This way you will pass the productID as a parameter to differentiate where the quiz was taken from.
    URL parameters (also known as query strings) are a way to structure additional information for a given URL. Parameters are added to the end of a URL after a `?` symbol, and multiple parameters can be included when separated by the `&` symbol.
    In order to pre-fill certain quiz responses, you can pass the following URL parameters when linking to your store (eg. linking from a newsletter):
    ```html
    prq_name=John Doe
    prq_email=john.doe@gmail.com
    prq_phone=+15556219645
    prq_cdRDCc=xDAwDe;aSEfBq
    // question ID - choices IDs separated by ;
    ```
    In case of differences in the values declared in the `window.prq_vars` and the values passed via URL parameters, the URL parameters will prevail.
    ### Example
    Here‚Äôs a link to our demo store **without passing parameters**. You‚Äôll see that you have to fill in all the questions, including the name and email. Click on the following link and take the quiz:
    [https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/pages/inline-quiz/](https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/pages/inline-quiz/)
    On the other hand, in this other link we are passing URL parameters:
    [https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/pages/inline-quiz/?prq_name=John%20Doe&prq_email=john.doe@gmail.com](https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/pages/inline-quiz/?prq_name=John%20Doe&prq_email=john.doe@gmail.com)
    You‚Äôll notice that if you take the quiz now, the ‚Äúname‚Äù and ‚Äúemail‚Äù questions are pre-filled and skipped.

# How to Set Up Automatic Popups

This guide walks you through setting up automatic popups on your eCommerce store, including popups that appear based on time spent on a page, across all pages, on the homepage, with exit intent, and options for showing popups multiple times per session.

!!! info "What's an Automatic Popup?"
    It's a quiz popup that appears after X seconds. The popup is shown only once per session unless `Exit Intent` option is enabled in the popup settings. Automatic popups can significantly enhance user engagement by presenting timely content or interactive elements like quizzes. 

!!! warning

    Automatic popups can be very intrusive which is why, by default, they are shown only once per customer session.

!!! note "Before you start"

    Before you start ensure you have a quiz created with the RevenueHunt app, access to the theme editor and (optional) basic understanding of HTML for editing themes.

    *Note: Directly editing your Shopify or other eCommerce theme's source code can potentially disrupt your store's functionality. If unsure about some steps, consider hiring a developer.*

Therefore, the link popup will open over any page in your store and there's no automatic way to open it over a specific page only. 
    !!! info "Add the embed.js to a specific page"
        Your developer can, however, add the following `embed.js` to a cusotm liquid or HTML element of a specific page template to open the quiz as a popup over that page only.
        ```html
        <script src="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/embed.js" async></script>
        ```
        Without it, the quiz won't be loaded on your website.

    4.  **Navigate to Themes**: Go to `Online Store > Themes`.
    5. **Enter Theme Customization**: Find the theme you wish to edit and click on the **"Customize"** button.
    6. **Add a New Section**: Click on **"Add section"** and select **"Image banner"** (or a similar option) from the list.
    7. **Insert a Button Block**: Within the "Image banner" section, add a new block and choose the **"Button"** option.
    8. **Paste the Quiz Link**: Click on the newly added button block to edit its settings. Paste the link to your quiz in the appropriate field.
    9. **Save Changes**: Make sure to save your changes by clicking on the **"Save"** button.
    With the legacy version of the RevenueHunt app for Shopify the `embed.js` script is automatically added to the whole website when you activate the `Link Popup Quiz` in `App Embeds` of your theme. Therefore, the link popup will open over any page in your store and there's no automatic way to open it over a specific page only. 
    !!! info "Add the embed.js to a specific page"
        Your developer can, however, add the following `embed.js` to a cusotm liquid or HTML element of a specific page template to open the quiz as a popup over that page only.
        ```html
        <script src="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/embed.js" async></script>
        ```
        Without it, the quiz won't be loaded on your website.
    To open a specific quiz, just **add the Quiz ID to the link** like this `#quiz-QUIZID`. 
    For example, `https://yourstore.myshopify.com/#quiz-123` can open one quiz, while  `https://yourstore.myshopify.com/#quiz-456` can open another.
    !!! info "Quiz ID"
        To find your Quiz ID, go to the [Dashboard](/reference/dashboard/), find the quiz you want to open. Then, click on the `...` three dots next to the quiz and select "Copy Quiz ID".
        Keep in mind that the Quiz ID is case-sensitive.
    If the Quiz Popup displays behind your website header or the `X` closing button is not visible, try these solutions:
    - **Decrease the Z-index of your website's header.** You may need to check your theme files or contact your theme developer to do this.
    - **Move the `X` closing sign lower.** You can move the `X` quiz closing sign lower on the popup with a bit of custom HTML/CSS code that can be added to your website's theme or an empty HTML/custom liquid block on the page where the quiz popup is shown. Here's a sample code:
        ```html
        <style>
        .rh-widget span {
        top: 150px !important;
        }
        </style>
        ```
    - **Publish the quiz inline with a page instead.** If you don't want to make changes you can publish the quiz inline on a new page in your store. This way the quiz will be a part of it and you can link to that quiz page from other parts of your website. Check the instructions [here](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-inline/#embedding-an-inline-quiz-on-a-new-page).
    For Shopify (V1), you can link to specific quizzes by creating different popup links for each quiz.
    1. Go to the [`Share`](/reference/quiz-builder/share-publish/) section for each quiz.
    2. Navigate to `Link > Show Instructions for legacy themes`.
    3. Click on `Get the code` to copy the unique link for that specific quiz.
    4. Add each unique link to different menu items, buttons, or page elements.
    If you see the error message "The quiz you are looking for does not exist" when trying to link to a quiz, follow these steps:
    1. Go back to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and ensure that the quiz has been published with the top right `Publish` button.
    2. Go to [Quiz Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/) and **copy the Quiz ID**. Then in Shopify, go back to Online Store > Themes > Customize and under the `App Embeds` section active the `Link Popup Quiz`. 
    3. Check the Quiz Link. Ensure that the link you've added to your menu or a button is correctly formatted and it follows the format `#quiz-QUIZID`. Where the Quiz ID is the ID you've copied from the Quiz Settings. *Note: the Quiz ID is case-sensitive.*
    4. Save your changes and refresh the page.

# How to recommend products that match multiple criteria (matrix)

This article outlines a method for recommending skincare products based on multiple criteria using a product matrix to categorize recommendations. 

It describes a step-by-step process involving creating product collections, linking products, and using a voting system algorithm to prioritize product suggestions, catering to complex customer profiles and ensuring personalized recommendations.

## Simple product matrix

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

Let‚Äôs say that you run a skincare shop and want to recommend a product based on two criteria ‚Äì the client‚Äôs age and skin type.
    This means that your product matrix looks something like this:
    | Age/Skin type   | Dry or Normal                                                                                                                                                 | Oily                                                                                                                                                                  |
    |-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Teens and 20‚Äôs  | Redness-Relief Refreshing Cleansing Lotion;<br>Ultra Facial Toner;<br>Khadi Global Natural Hyaluronic Acid Serum;<br>Moisturizing Cream-Gel                   | Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Face Wash;<br>Balancing Force Oil Control Toner;<br>Resist Ultra-Light Super Antioxidant Concentrate Serum;<br>Oil-Free Moisture Lotion     |
    | 30‚Äôs and above  | All Natural Face Cleanser;<br>Fresh Rose Deep Hydration Toner;<br>Khadi Global Natural Hyaluronic Acid Serum;<br>Organix Facial Moisturizer                     | FIRST AID BEAUTY FACE CLEANSER;<br>Balancing Force Oil Control Toner;<br>The Ordinary ‚ÄúBuffet‚Äù + Copper Peptides 1%;<br>Oil-Free Moisture-Combination Skin           |
    You can start building your quiz. 
    1. **Add new quiz**: Go to the RevenueHunt app and click on `add new quiz`. 
    2. **Name the quiz**: Name the quiz and you‚Äôll be directed to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/).
    3. **Add questions**: Based on the above table, two questions will be necessary to determine the right product for the customer. 
        - The first question is about the client‚Äôs age.
        ![how to recommend products matrix question1](/images/how_to_recommend_products_question1.png)
        - The second question is about client‚Äôs skin type.
        ![how to recommend products matrix question2](/images/how_to_recommend_products_question2.png)
    You should link the collections created in [Step 2](#step-2-create-collections) to the choices in the quiz. 
    1. **Open Link Collections/Categories tab**: To do that, navigate to the [Link Collections/Categories](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/) tab in the Quiz Builder.
    2. **Link Collections/Categories to choices**: Link the collections/categories to chocies as shown below.
        ![how to recommend products matrix link collections](/images/how_to_recommend_products_linkcollections.png)
    For the products to show on the Results Page, you need to add a `Products Block`. 
    1. **Go to the Results Page tab**: You can do that by navigating to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/).
    2. **Add a Product Block**:  Clicking the `+` to add a block type. Slect a `Product Block` from the dropdown list.
    3. **Limit the number of recommended products**: In this example, we should limit the amount of recommended products to 4 (based on the matrix). To limit the number of recommended products shown open the `Product Block settings` and select how many products should be recommended in this Product Block from the dropdown.
    If your product Matrix looks more like a list, there is another way to achieve your precise product recommendations.  Let‚Äôs look at the matrix below. 
    ![how to recommend products complex matrix](/images/how_to_recommend_products_complexmatrix.png)
    The outcome of the quiz depends on 3 factors: skin type, age, and skin concern. In each case, the products recommended differing.
    For this complex matrix, creating separate collections for each outcome is possible, but there‚Äôs also an alternative. What you can do instead is to pick one of the factors and create branching in the quiz with [Jump Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic). This will allow you to show the customer the same questions but link different products to each branch, therefore resulting in different outcomes.
    Here‚Äôs an example of a Conditional Logic tree for the Matrix above where Skin Type was chosen as a branchign factor:
    ![how to recommend products complex matrix logic tree](/images/how_to_recommend_products_complexmatrix_logictree.png)
    The Jump Logic for bnranching is applied to *Question 2*, the skin type question.
    ![how to recommend products complex matrix jump logic 1](/images/how_to_recommend_products_complexmatrix_jumplogic1.png)
    ![how to recommend products complex matrix jump logic 2](/images/how_to_recommend_products_complexmatrix_jumplogic2.png)
    And *Questions 4, 6, 8, and 10* to point the customer to the Results Page directly after completing the branch:
    ![how to recommend products complex matrix jump logic 3](/images/how_to_recommend_products_complexmatrix_jumplogic3.png)
    This setup allows you to link different products to the same questions leading to differnt results, while maintaining the same customer experince.
    !!! tip
        Check this guide [Set up fixed recommendations quiz](/how-to-guides/set-up-fixed-recommendations-quiz/) to learn how to set up a quiz with fixed recommendations and display logic for very precise product recommendations.
    !!! warning
        A lot of conditional logic can significantly slow down the loading times of the quiz builder app (it doesn‚Äôt affect the quiz as viewed by the customer though). 
        If you plan on building a quiz with a lot of conditional logic, **consider splitting the quiz into multiple smaller quizzes** instead. There‚Äôs no limit to how many quizzes can be published on your webiste. 
        In the example above, you can create 4 different quizzes for skin types (Dry, Oily, Combination, or Normal skin), or you can create a quiz for different age groups.

# How to Recommend Products Based on Number of User Choices

??? question "Do I need advanced technical skills to set this up?"

    While the process isn‚Äôt entirely plug-and-play, with the assistance of a developer, it‚Äôs manageable. If you‚Äôre not familiar with JavaScript or CSS, seeking developer help is advisable.

## How do I recommend products based on the number of user choices?

The recommendation process is based on how many choices the user selects out of the given set. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide:

1. **Create collections/categories**. Create distinct collections for each group of products you wish to recommend, e.g., ‚Äú1/10 choices selected,‚Äù ‚Äú2/10 choices selected,‚Äù etc.
2. **Add hidden choices**. In your final question, include a multiple-choice option that correlates with the aforementioned collections/categories. This ensures that each choice connects to its respective recommended collection/category. Make sure to hide these choices from the user with custom CSS code.
3. **Add custom JavaScript**. Using custom JavaScript, evaluate the choices selected throughout the quiz and write a piece of code that automatically selects one of the hidden choices in the last question. This will determine which product collection/category to recommend based on the number of choices the user made.

## How can I ensure that users don‚Äôt see the choices in the last question?

You can hide these technical choices in the last question using custom CSS code. A guide on how to customize the quiz design can be found [here](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/).

## Where do I input the custom JavaScript code?

[This article](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) explains how to add custom JavaScript code to quiz questions. For example:

![recommend-products-based-on-number-of-user-choices image1](/images/recommend-products-based-on-number-of-user-choices_image1.png)

The custom JavaScript code should be integrated into the final question to assess the user‚Äôs choices and click the right choices in order to recommend a product collection accordingly.

## How can I identify the selected choices from each slide or question with JavaScript?

To review the values or choice IDs selected for each slide/question, you can use the JavaScript console and search for the values:

![recommend-products-based-on-number-of-user-choices image2](/images/recommend-products-based-on-number-of-user-choices_image2.png)

This guide provides information on how to set up a custom solution that will recommend products based on the number of user choices.

# How to Recommend Products Based on Numerical Inputs

Recommending products based on numerical answers (like age or room size) can be tricky if you use open-ended input fields. This guide will show you how to structure these questions in your quiz to trigger tailored recommendations using finite answer choices.

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

Open-ended numerical questions like [Number](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#number) or [Date](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#date) allow users to enter any value ‚Äî but that flexibility comes with a cost: **you can't directly link recommendations to those answers**. To deliver accurate product suggestions, you'll need a structured approach.
    ![open-ended numerical question](/images/how_to_recommend_products_based_on_numerical_inputs_shopify_agequestion_number.png)
    Questions like "What's your age?", "What's your birth date?" or "How big is your room?" might seem useful, but since users can input any number, you can't associate specific product recommendations with those responses.
    To make recommendations work, **use multiple choice or dropdown questions**. Instead of asking for a number, offer predefined numbers or ranges.
    !!! example "Example - Age Ranges"
        Change "What's your age?" from an input field to a dropdown with:
        - Under 20
        - 21‚Äì30
        - 31‚Äì40
        - Over 40
        This lets you assign relevant products to each range.
        ![use dropdown question to ask age ranges](/images/how_to_recommend_products_based_on_numerical_inputs_shopify_agequestion_dropdown.png)
    Once you switch to finite answers, you can:
    - [Upvote](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) specific products, variants or collections to each choice
    - Set up [Jump Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) or [Display logic](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#display-logic-display-section-logic) based on the user's choices
    This is how to make sure that the product recommendation logic works in your quiz.
    After generating options, you can:
    - Switch between question types (dropdown, multiple choice, etc.) via [Block Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings)
    - Tweak the answer labels in [Choice Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings)
    - Assign products to each choice via the [Choice Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings)
    - Set up [Jump Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) or [Display logic](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#display-logic-display-section-logic) based on the user's choices
    This helps users select a range easily while ensuring you offer relevant products.
    RevenueHunt Quizzes currently doesn't have a feature that would allow custom result calculations based on numerical user input.
    If you're building a quiz that requires custom calculations based on a precise numerical user input, for example a BMI calculation or dosage calculation, your developer can use the [Custom JavaScript](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) feature to add custom logic to your quiz results page. This approach involves accessing the quiz answers via the `console.log()` on the results page, programing custom behaviors on the result page with JavaScript and printing an output onto an HTML element. 
    In our [JavaScript guide](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) we provide an example of adding a [BMI calculator](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/#example-2-insert-calculations) to your results page.

# How to Recommend Products

Our solution takes into account your customer's choices to offer highly personalized product recommendations. 

This guide explains how to recommend products with the RevenueHunt app, the underlying algorithm and proposes solutions for complex quizzes.

## Recommendations

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz can show on the results page **product variants**, **main products** and **[Recharge subscription products](/how-to-guides/recommend-subscription-products/)**. 
    RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz **cannot recommend collections** of products, though it's possible to [only recommend products from a specific collection](/how-to-guides/recommend-skincare-routine-slots/).
    Follow these steps to set up product recommendations in your Product Recommendation Quiz:
    1. **Link Products to Choices**: Navigate to the [Link Products/Collections/Upvote](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) tab within your quiz setup. For each choice, link/upvote relevant products. 
        - You can link./upvote product variants, collections, tags, variant collections, vendor collections or all variants of the same product at once.
    2. **Edit the Results Page**: In the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) tab you can edit the content of your results screen. You can add a heading, content block, image block, HTML block, Product Block or a Product Slot block. 
        !!! tip
            Check [How to Edit the Results Page](/how-to-guides/edit-results-page/) for more information.
    3. **Add a Product Block**: Products can be displayed on the Results Page as a list via the `Product Block` or divided into slots via the `Product Slot Block`. For beginners, it's recommended to use a `Product Block` to show the recommendations.
        - **Product Block** displays the products sorted by the number of votes - the most voted products are shown first, and the least voted last. In [Product Block settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) you can **choose how many products you want to show** at the end of the quiz.
            ![how to recommend products product block](/images/how_to_recommend_products_product_block.png){width="500"}
        - **Product Slot Blocks** allow you to display the products in clear steps, for example as a skincare routine. Each Product Slot will recommend the most-voted product from a collection that's linked to it. *Check [How to Recommend a Skincare Routine with Slots](/how-to-guides/recommend-skincare-routine-slots/) for step-by-step instructions on how to set up Slot Blocks.* 
            ![how to recommend products slots block](/images/how_to_recommend_products_slots_block.png)
    4. **Test the Results**: After your products are linked and the results page is set up, you can test your quiz.
        - Click [`Publish/Save`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) on the top-right menu to update the preview/live quiz. 
        - Then, click [`Preview`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) to test the quiz you've created in a new window. 
            !!! note
                You can test the quiz as much as you like as long as you always open a new preview window. These test responses done as admin are automatically removed after 1 hour to not add to your usage quota.
    5. **Troubleshoot the Results**: Use the quiz's [built-in search tool](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) in the `Responses` section to understand why specific products were recommended or missing from the recommendations. 
        !!! tip
            Check [How to Troubleshoot Quiz Results](/how-to-guides/troubleshoot-product-results/) for detailed instructions on how to use this tool.
    6. **Refine the Results**: If you want to make the results ultra-precise, you can also:
        - **Limit the recommendations**: You can choose to limit the recommendations to only show products that received X votes or more in the [Results Page settings](/how-to-guides/only-recommend-products-with-minimum-votes/).
        - **Use Exclusions**: You can use [Exclusions](#exclusion) to make sure that unwanted products are not shown (even if they were upvoted in another choice earlier).
    By linking product variants and collections to quiz choices, and understanding the inclusion/exclusion logic, you can use our algorithm to offer precise product recommendations.
    Check the quiz to learn how to build the quiz outcome you want or consult the *How-to* guides listed below.
    <script src="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/embed.js" async></script><div class="rh-widget rh-inline" data-url="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/X2Hy6G" style="margin: 10px auto; width: 100%; height: 600px; display: flex;"></div>
    If you're using a legacy version of the RevenueHunt app for Shopify and Rechare Subscriptions check [this guide](/how-to-guides/recommend-subscription-products/) to learn how to recommend subscription products directly from the quiz.
    ![how to recommend subscription products sample product](/images/how_to_recommend_subscription_products_sample_product.png){width="150"}
    For other subscription apps check [this guide](/how-to-guides/recommend-subscription-products/#other-subscriptions) to learn of a possible workaround.
    [:fontawesome-solid-arrow-right: learn more](/how-to-guides/recommend-subscription-products/)
    While our product recommendation algorithm works to recommend specific products, it will not automatically display an explanation of **why** a certain product was recommended. It also won't automatically display custom text depending on the recommended product. That's why it's hard to build a "personality-type" quiz with our legacy solution.
    If you're using a legacy version of the RevenueHunt app for Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, BigCommerce or Headless eCommerce (Standalone) check this guide to learn about possible workarounds: [How to Show Results Explanation](/how-to-guides/show-results-explanation/).

# How to Recommend a Skincare Routine with Slots

With RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz, it is possible to group products into slots and recommend a product for each step in a beauty routine.

This guide is designed to help merchants effectively use [Product Slot Blocks](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#block-types) on the results page to organize product recommendations.

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

<div class="videoWrapper">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gfIwTn9hp8E?si=osTF2c3z9afF7IU1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
    To group products into slots, you‚Äôll need to create new collections in your Shopify store. These collections will be used to group your products on the results page.
    1. **Identify Product Categories**: Determine your skincare product categories (e.g., Cleansers, Toners, Serums, Moisturizers).
    2. **Create Collections**: For each category, [create a collection in your Shopify store](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/collections) with the right products. Each collection should only contain products relevant to its category. For example, 
        - a *Cleansers* collection should have all the cleansing products, a *Toners* collection should have all the toning products, 
        - a *Serums* collection should have all the serums, etc. 
        - You can have more than one collection that includes some of the same products.
        ![how to recommend slots cleansers collection](/images/how_to_recommend_slots_cleansers_collection.png)
    3. **Catalog Sync**: Perform a [catlog sync](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/) after creating collections to update RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz with the latest product collections.
    1. **Go to Link Products/Collections tab**: In the Quiz Builder, go to [Link Products](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) or [Link Collections/Categories](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/) tab.
    2. **Link Products**: Link all relevant product variants or collections to each choice. Ensure every choice in your quiz is linked to at least one product or collection to prevent empty results. If a product does not recieve at least one vote, it will never show up on the results page.
        ![how to recommend slots link products](/images/how_to_recommend_slots_link_products.png)
    1. **Edit the Results Page**: Go to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) tab and edit the content. Add design elements like headings, logos, and content blocks.
    2. **Add a Product Slots Block**: Use the `+` button to add a `Product Slots Block` to the Results Page.
    3. **Add Slots**: Open the [`Slot Block settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) and add a slot for each step in the skincare routine. For example, if your routine consists of 4 products, you should add 4 slots to your Slots Block.
    4. **Edit the Slot**: You can add a title or a description to each slot.
    5. **Include Collections/Categories into Slots**: Link the corresponding product collection/category to each slot in the `Include` section. It's vital for displaying recommendations. Slot can only show most-voted products from a collection/category that's included.
    ![how to recommend slots slot block](/images/how_to_recommend_slots_slot_block.png)
    6. **Choose Product number**: In the [`Slot Block settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) you can choose how many products should be recommended per each step. *Tip: Our most succseful quizzes recommend a single product per slot.*

# How to Recommend Subscription Products

This guide explains how to integrate and recommend subscription products with RevenueHunt app.

Recommending subscription products via the RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz can simplify your e-commerce strategy by providing a steady revenue stream and fostering long-term customer relationships. 

However, not all subscription apps are supported yet with the RevenueHunt app. Currently, we support [ReCharge Subscriptions](https://apps.shopify.com/subscription-payments?surface_intra_position=1&surface_type=partners&surface_version=redesign) for Shopify V1 (legacy version) and [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) for WooCommerce.

If you're using a subscription app that is not supported, you can still recommend subscription products to your users by sending them to a single-time payment product page from the quiz results using [this workaround](#other-subscriptions). This will allow your users to subscribe to the product from the product page.

![how to recommend subscription products sample product](/images/how_to_recommend_subscription_products_sample_product.png)


!!! warning

    RevenueHunt app currently only integrates with [ReCharge Subscriptions](https://apps.shopify.com/subscription-payments?surface_intra_position=1&surface_type=partners&surface_version=redesign) for Shopify V1 (legacy version) and [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) for WooCommerce. Subscription products are not yet supported in the Product Recommendation Quiz for Shopify (new version),BigCommerce or Magento. They will not show up on the Results page. However, there‚Äôs a workaround explained in the [Other subscriptions](#other-subscriptions) section of the article.

## ReCharge Subscriptions

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

Here‚Äôs how to connect your ReCharge subscriptions to your RevenueHunt app:
    1. **Open the RevenueHunt App:** Start by accessing your account on the app.
    2. **Navigate and Connect:** In your quiz dashboard, select the [Connect](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab. Scroll down to the **ReCharge** section and click on the `connect` button.
    3. **Sync the store**: Go to your dashboard > [success checklist](/reference/dashboard/#success-checklist) and run a [catalog sync](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/). The sync can take up to 30 - 60 minutes.
    4. **Link Products to Quiz Choices:** In the [Link Products](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) tab, associate your ReCharge subscription products with the corresponding choices. 
    5. **Publish Your Changes:** After linking the products, don‚Äôt forget to hit the `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.
    Integrating ReCharge with Shopify enhances your ability to recommend subscription products, but there are limitations and best practices to consider:
    - It is not possible to add all products to the cart with a single button; each subscription has to be chosen and added separately.
    - The subscription duration can only be chosen on the results page. It is not possible to recommend a specific subscription duration.
    - The customer needs to proceed to the cart first and cannot proceed to checkout directly with subscription products. You can change this in the [checkout settings](/how-to-guides/change-checkout-settings/).
    - We only integrate with the **new Shopify Checkout**; the old Recharge Checkout is not supported. For instructions on how to migrate from the old ReCharge Checkout to the new Shopify Checkout, check [this article](https://support.rechargepayments.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403505928599).
    Not applicable.
    For other subscription apps, there's a workaround that allows you to still guide your customers towards subscription options via the Product Reocommendation Quiz. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to implement this workaround effectively:
    **Step 1: Link One-Time Payment Products to Quiz Choices**
    1. Identify your subscription products that you wish to promote through the quiz.
    2. **Create one-time payment options**: Create equivalent one-time payment products for each of your subscription items. These will serve as placeholders in the quiz.
    3. **Link one-time payment products to chocies**: In the [Link Products](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) section, link each of these one-time payment products to the relevant quiz choices. This ensures that when a customer selects an option that would traditionally lead to a subscription product, they are instead matched with the corresponding one-time payment product.
    **Step 2: Adjust Checkout Settings**
    1. **Open Results Page settings**: Navigate to the [Results Page settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) within your Product Recommendation Quiz Results Page.
    2. **Change Checkout Settings**: Change the [Checkout Settings](/how-to-guides/change-checkout-settings/) from ‚ÄúAdd to cart‚Äù to ‚ÄúLink to product.‚Äù This adjustment ensures that instead of adding the product directly to their shopping cart, customers will be directed to the product page on your website.
    As a result, the buyers will go directly to the product page and can subscribe there.

# How to Redirect Quiz to Another Page

In this guide, we'll explore several methods to redirect your customers to another page following the completion of a quiz. Below, you'll find detailed steps for implementing page redirection using various techniques within a quiz environment.

## Using Jump Logic for Conditional Redirection

[Jump Logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/) offers a dynamic way to direct customers to specific URLs based on their quiz interactions. Here's how to implement it:

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

1. **Navigate to the Conditional Logic Section**: In the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/), locate the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab, select the last question in the quiz (or another question if you want to redirect the customer after a specific question). In the menu that opens, go the [`Jump Logic`](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) tab. 
    2. **Configure URL Redirection**: Specify the URL to which customers should be redirected to. This can be set to occur after a specific question or based on selected answers.
    	![how to redirect quiz ot another page jump logic](/images/how_to_redirect_quiz_ot_another_page_jump_logic.png)
    3. **Publish & Test Your Setup**: Click the top-right `Publish/Save` button to update the preview/live quiz. Then, `Preview` the quiz to ensure the redirection wors correctly. 
    Even if you redirect the customer with Jump Logic to another page the quiz responses will be saved in the Quiz Builder's [`Metrics`](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) section.
    !!! warning
          To do this, you'll need basic knowledge of JavaScript and handling JSON data.
    1. **Set Up the Callback Function**: Implement the [callback function](/how-to-guides/use-callback-function/) on your website to capture quiz results in JSON format.
    2. **Store and Redirect**: Configure the function to store the results locally (e.g., in the browser's local storage or cookies) before redirecting the user to your custom Results Page.
    3. **Access the Results Page First**: The callback function is designed to trigger upon reaching the quiz's results page. Make sure that the results page is loaded even for a fraction of a second for the data to trasfer correctly. This sequence ensures that the callback captures the quiz response, saving it as JSON in your website's local storage/cookies, before any redirection occurs. 
    4. **Use the Data**: On your custom page, use the `console.log(quizResponse)` function to retrieve and use the quiz data as needed.
    For a more detailed guide on setting up the callback function, refer to [this resource](/how-to-guides/use-callback-function/).
      Offering a direct link to another page from your [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) can be achieved simply with an **HTML button**.
      1. **Add an HTML Block**: In the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) editor, click the `+` button to insert an `HTML block`.
      2. **Insert the Button Code**: Use the following HTML snippet to add a button:
            ```html
            <a class="button" href="https://revenuehunt.com/">Visit RevenueHunt.com</a>
            ```
      Edit the link URL and text to your liking.
      3. **Customize Appearance**: Style the button with CSS. You can add custom styles in the [Quiz Design](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/) tab, targeting the button with `.lq-results a.button`.

# How to Restore Quiz Progress

Accidentally losing progress or facing unintended changes made by a colleague can be frustrating. Fortunately, if you find yourself in such a situation with your quiz, there is a way to recover a previous stable version of your Product Recommendation Quiz. 

This guide will walk you through the process of using the [Version History](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#version-history) feature to recover an earlier version of your quiz, ensuring your hard work isn't lost.

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/c04e2d8b2548424696c2743d8f846ed8?sid=fe2edbcd-7f82-4735-9c5e-f0ed0f15157b" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    The [Version History](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#version-history) function allows you to browse through saved versions of your quiz, offering a safeguard against accidental loss or changes.
    1. **Open Your Quiz**: Navigate to the quiz you're working on.
    2. **Go to Quiz Settings**: Look for the [Quiz Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/) option within the Quiz Builder.
    3. **Find the Version History Tab**: Within the Quiz Settings, locate the [Version History](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#version-history) tab. Here, you'll see a list of the saved versions of your quiz.
    ![Version History](/images/manual_quizbuilder_quizsettings_versionhistory.png){width="500"}
    Version History does not track every minor edit. Instead, it captures a new version each time you publish changes to your quiz with the top-right `Publish` button. 
    - A new version is saved only when you click `Publish` on your quiz. This action updates the preview/live quiz and records a version in the history. 
    - The interface uses colored `tags` to indicate where changes were made, such as to `questions` or `settings`, making it easier to identify the nature of each version. 
    - For better organization and clarity, you have the option to `rename` any saved version. This can help you keep track of significant changes or versions you may want to revert to later.
    If you need to recover a previous version of the quiz:
    1. **Select the Version**: Identify the version you want to recover from the list. Use the colored `tags` and `time stamps` as a guide to find the version with the desired changes.
    2. **Use the Three Dots Menu**: Next to the version you want to recover, click on the three dots menu `...` for options.
    3. **Recover Quiz Version**: Select to `create a new quiz from this version`. Once clicked, a new quiz copy will appear on your [Dashboard](/reference/dashboard/).
    4. **Re-publish the Quiz**: After creating the new quiz, you need to re-publish the quiz to make it live on your store, replacing the old quiz.
    !!! warning
        It is not possible to replace the current quiz with a previous version while keeping the same quiz ID. You can only create a new quiz from a previous version.

# How to Send Leads to ActiveCampaign

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

Integrating your RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz with ActiveCampaign allows for a seamless transition of valuable customer data directly into your email marketing campaigns and CRM management. 
    This guide will navigate you through the steps to link your quiz with ActiveCampaign, enabling you to use quiz data for targeted follow-ups and improved customer engagement.
    Before you begin, ensure you have:
    - An active ActiveCampaign account.
    - A quiz built on the RevenueHunt platform.
    !!! note
        The integration process mainly involves transferring raw data from the quiz to ActiveCampaign. Setting up detailed flows or custom events based on this data is managed within ActiveCampaign itself.
    To integrate your quiz with ActiveCampaign:
    1. Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/).
    2. Click on the [Connect](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab located at the top of the screen to access the integration settings.
    3. In the integration options, locate ActiveCampaign and copy the `API Token`. You'll need it later.
        ![how to send leads to activecampaign](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_activecampaign.png)
    4. Click the `Connect` button within the ActiveCampaign section.
    4. Once clicked, you'll be redirected to a configuration page in your ActiveCampaign account. Click on `Add an account`.
        ![how to send leads to activecampaign step1](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_activecampaign_step1.png)
    5. Enter your `API Token` when prompted.
        ![how to send leads to activecampaign step2](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_activecampaign_step2.png)
    5. Select the specific quiz you wish to integrate and proceed by clicking `Continue`.
        ![how to send leads to activecampaign step3](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_activecampaign_step3.png)
    6. Map your quiz responses to the corresponding fields in ActiveCampaign to ensure data is correctly synchronized. This may involve adding new field mappings if necessary.
        ![how to activecampaign connect](/images/how_to_activecampaign_connect.png)
    Once configured, your quiz will be connected, and you can modify settings or update the integration directly from this interface.
    ![how to send leads to activecampaign step final](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_activecampaign_step_final.png)
    Alternatively, you can initiate the connection from within ActiveCampaign:
    1. Go to the Apps menu in ActiveCampaign and search for `Product Recommendation Quiz`.
        !!! warning
            If you're unable to see the Apps page in your account, it is likely because ActiveCampaign branding is turned off for your account. Please try toggling the ActiveCampaign branding setting off and then back on in your account settings. Once you've done that, check if the Apps page appears
    2. Select the quiz icon and follow the provided setup instructions. During the setup process, you will be prompted to enter your `ActiveCampaign API Token`. This token is essential for linking the quiz data with your ActiveCampaign account and can be found in the [`Connect`](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) > ActiveCampaign section of the app.
    !!! note
        Note that the Quiz is only responsible for sending the raw data, you will have to configure a flow or any other custom event you wish to make with the data within ActiveCampaign in itself, and any questions regarding this process should be asked to ActiveCampaign‚Äôs support team directly.
    Sometimes, you would like a bit more control over the data that is sent to ActiveCampaign. In that case there are a few alternatives you can use to send quiz leads to ActiveCampaign.
    - **Using Zapier**: You can use out native Zapier integration to send quiz leads to ActiveCampaign. Just connect your quiz to Zapier following [this guide](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-zapier/). Then, in Zapier set up a redirection of selected data to ActiveCampaign.
    - **Using Webhooks**: You can use our Webhooks integration to send quiz leads to ActiveCampaign. Just connect your quiz to Webhooks following [this guide](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-webhooks/). Then, in Webhooks set up a redirection of selected data to ActiveCampaign.
    - **Manually adding the quiz leads to ActiveCampaign**: You can manually add the quiz leads to ActiveCampaign by uploading a CSV file generated from the quiz [metrics > responses](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) section.
    With the quiz integrated, you might want to enhance contact profiles with additional custom information derived from quiz results.
    Here‚Äôs a list of additional custom information that can be added to your contact profile:
    - Email
    - First Name
    - Full Name
    - Quiz ID
    - Quiz Name
    - Response ID
    - Tags
    - Permalink
    - Permalink Hash
    - Recommended Product IDs
    To add these fields to a new profile:
    1. Navigate to `Lists -> Manage fields` within ActiveCampaign and click `Add Field` to create new fields for the extra quiz data.
        ![how to send leads to activecampaign new field1](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_activecampaign_new_field1.png)
    2. Name each field appropriately. These fields will be categorized under `General Details`.
        ![how to send leads to activecampaign new field2](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_activecampaign_new_field2.png)
    3. These fields will be categorized under `General Details`.
        ![how to send leads to activecampaign new field3](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_activecampaign_new_field3.png)
    3. Return to the Product Recommendation Quiz app in ActiveCampaign to map these new fields, ensuring future contacts from the quiz are enriched with this custom information.
        ![how to activecampaign mapping](/images/how_to_activecampaign_mapping.png)
    After that, all the new contacts from the quiz will receive more custom information.
    ![how to activecampaign profile](/images/how_to_activecampaign_profile.png)
    To send automatic follow-up emails to quiz takers, you can set up an automation in ActiveCampaign.
    To automate email communications based on quiz participation:
    1. Within ActiveCampaign, go to the `Automations` menu and create a new automation.
    2. Set a trigger related to the Product Recommendation Quiz by selecting the appropriate quiz under `Apps`.
        ![how to activecampaign automation](/images/how_to_activecampaign_automation.gif)
    3. Following the trigger setup, design your email template. Incorporate personalization by adding `custom properties`, such as direct links to quiz responses, to your text blocks.
        ![how to activecampaign add custom properties](/images/how_to_activecampaign_add_custom_properties.gif)
    Unfortunately, for now, the only information about the recommended products we‚Äôre able to send to Activecampaign is the Recommended Product IDs. This is not enough information to display the whole list of recommended products.
    To show any products in an ActiveCampaign you may need to connect your ActiveCampaign to Shopify first. Then by adding a product block, you should be able to display products from specific collections. It could be possible to add multiple product blocks and have them shown or hidden based on the recommended product ID, however, this option has not been yet tested thoroughly.

    2. The first step is creating a segment that contains only quiz takers. You can use custom properties sent to Hubspot profiles to create **segmented lists** based your customers responses to the quiz so you can follow up with hyper-segmented campaigns.
        !!! tip
            Check [this HubSpot article](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/lists/create-active-or-static-lists) to learn how to create lists.
    3. You can use the segment as a trigger for your campaign, ensuring that only quiz takers receive the email.
    4. Set up your campaign and email flow.
    5. You can use the **Personalization Token** feature to personalize the email based on the quiz data. Check the [Using Custom Quiz Properties in Email Templates](#using-custom-quiz-properties-in-email-templates) section to learn how to do this.
    6. Turn your campaign on and Hubspot will automatically send the email to the customers in the segment, helping you follow up with your quiz takers and recover lost sales.
    To personalize your follow-up emails based on quiz data, you‚Äôll need to pull custom properties into the email templates.
    1. In HubSpot, navigate to `Marketing > Email > Create email`.
        ![how to hubspot image4](/images/how_to_hubspot_image4.png)
    2. In the email editor, use the **Personalization Token** feature.
    3. Click on `Insert`, then select Personalization Token from the dropdown.
        ![how to hubspot image5](/images/how_to_hubspot_image5.png)
    4. Choose the custom quiz properties that were captured with your Product Recommendation Quiz. HubSpot will automatically replace these tokens with each contact's respective data during the email send.
    5. Use the `Preview` feature to ensure that the custom properties are appearing correctly in your email.
        ![how to hubspot image6](/images/how_to_hubspot_image6.png)
    !!! info
        Please be aware that while HubSpot efficiently handles text-based quiz data, its interface currently **does not support embedding images** directly into email templates as custom properties. Plan your quiz content accordingly to ensure seamless integration and utilization within HubSpot.

# How to Send Quiz Leads to Klaviyo

Apart from giving your customers personalized product recommendations, you can connect your quiz to Klaviyo. This way all the contacts coming from the quiz will be added to your Klaviyo account and you can create targeted email campaigns to upsell them.

    </div>
    !!! tip "Tutorial"
        You can also follow our step-by-step tutorial to learn how to connect your quiz to Klaviyo and send leads to Klaviyo: [Sending Follow-up Emails with Klaviyo](/tutorials/follow-up-emails-klaviyo/)
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iIl2njV-UkI?si=MoMUJ1OTl-cmoBQo&amp;start=104" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    To connect the quiz to Klaviyo you‚Äôll have to provide your Klaviyo **Public API Key**. Public API Key is essential because it allows us to send information to Klaviyo Profiles.
    2. To find your Public Key login to your Klaviyo account. In account `Settings` open the `API Keys` tab and copy the public API Key. You can get your Klaviyo Public API Key [here](https://www.klaviyo.com/account#api-keys-tab).
        ![how to send leads to klaviyo public api key](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_klaviyo_public_api_key.png)
    3. Navigate back to the RevenueHunt app. 
    4. In the [`Quiz > Connect`](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab, scroll to Klaviyo and edit the connection. Paste your Public API Key and save.
        ![how to send leads to klaviyo public api key provided1](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_klaviyo_public_api_key_provided1.png)
        ![how to send leads to klaviyo public api key provided2](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_klaviyo_public_api_key_provided2.png)
    5. Publish the changes with the top-right `Publish` button.
    6. Test quiz all the way to the results. Make sure to provide a sample email that doesn‚Äôt already exist in your Kalviyo account.
    7. To verify the test, open `Kalviyo > Audeince > Profiles` section. If a new profile was added the integration was successful.
    From now on all the contacts coming from the quiz will be added to your Klaviyo account.
    **Custom Properties**
    Following these steps ensures that every quiz participant's contact information, alongside their responses and product recommendations, are forwarded to your Klaviyo account, registering as `custom properties` within Klaviyo customer Profiles. These properties are instrumental in personalizing Klaviyo email templates.
    ![how to send leads to klaviyo customer profile](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_klaviyo_customer_profile.png)
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iIl2njV-UkI?si=_NKZoiG-xGhV8IeO&amp;start=200" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    1. **Add Email Question**: To send contacts to Klaviyo your quiz needs to have an email question. You can add it to the quiz from the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) tab by clicking `+` and selecting `email` from the dropdown list. You can also [ask for marketing consent](/how-to-guides/ask-for-marketing-consent/) directly in the quiz.
    2. **Connect Quiz to Klaviyo**: Follow the instructions in [this](#link-your-quiz-to-klaviyo) section to learn how to connect your quiz to Klaviyo correctly.
    3. **Create a Segment**: All quiz contacts can be grouped into a segment in Klaviyo. 
        1. To create a new segment in Klaviyo go to  `Audience > List & Segements` and click `Create New > New Segment`.
        2. Name the segment and set up the definition.
        3. The `Permalink-QuizID`  property is unique for profiles coming from the quiz.
        4. If you don't see the permalink property in the dropdown menu, you may need to take a test quiz and try again.
        5. Click `Create a segment`.
    5. **Create an Email Flow**: You‚Äôll have to create a flow that is triggered when someone gets added to the segment we created in the previous step. This is the trickiest part, the emails you send have to be custom-built in Klaviyo. 
        **Trigger Flow**
        1. To create an email flow that includes only quiz takers open the `Flows` tab in Klaviyo. 
        2. Click `Create flow` and then `Build from scratch`.
        3. Name the flow and click `Create flow`.
        4. Next, you'll be asked to set up a flow trigger.
        5. Choose the trigger to be `Added to a segment` and select the segment created in the [previous step](/tutorials/follow-up-emails-klaviyo/#create-segment-for-quiz-takers). Click `Confirm` and `Confirm and save`. This way whenever someone enters the segment they will trigger the email flow.    
        **Optional: Update Marketing Consent**
        If you've [asked for marketing consent in the quiz](/how-to-guides/ask-for-marketing-consent/), you can update it in the Klaviyo email flow. Just follw these steps:
        1. Right below the flow trigger, add a `Profile property update` action.
        2. Click `+ Step`.
        3. A menu will appear letting up set up the profile property update.
        4. Select to `Update existing property`, from the Select property dropdown menu select `Accepts marketing` and set the value to `true`.
        5. Turn this action `LIVE`.
    6. **Edit the Email**: In the next steps, you should edit the email template.
        **Add Email Action**
        7. Click on the `three dots` and edit the email.
        8. Edit the name/subject/email to your liking and select the `HTML email template`.
        9. From the `Connect >  Klaviyo` tab you can download a ready-to-use email template. 
            ![how to send leads to klaviyo email tempalte download1](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_klaviyo_email_tempalte_download1.png)
            ![how to send leads to klaviyo email tempalte download2](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_klaviyo_email_tempalte_download2.png)
            !!! tip
                If you would rather create your own email template, check [this section](#use-quiz-data-in-klaviyo-email-templates) for more details.
        10. Copy the code and go back to Klaviyo.
        11. Open the `HTML email template` and remove the existing code.
        12. Paste the new template code.
        13. You can then `preview` the email as one of your segment subscribers.
        14. Make sure to `Save` the changes and click `Done`.
        15. Return to your flow and turn your email `LIVE`.
        From that moment on, all the quiz takers, who leave their email, will be automatically added to your Kalviyo Segment and will be sent a follow-up email. 
    7. **Re-trigger the flow**: If you want to send an email with each quiz retake, you can do that by adding a `Profile property update` action at the end of the flow. Follow these steps:
        1. Add a `Profile property update` action at the end of the flow.
        2. Click `+ Step`.
        3. Select `Delete existing property`.
        4. From the `Select property` dropdown menu select the property that was used to create a segment in earlier steps. 
            !!! example "Example"
                Select `Delete existing property` > `PERMALINK-QuizID`. 
                ![how to send leads to klaviyo resend email with each quiz retake](/images/how_to_klaviyo_resend_email_with_each_quiz_retake.png)
            ??? info "How to send an email every time someone completes the quiz?"
                First, you need to set up a segment based on the `PERMALINK-{{quiz_id}}` property to filter quiz takers. Once the segment is created, you can build a flow that triggers when users are added to this segment, sends them their quiz results via email, and then **removes the `PERMALINK-{{quiz_id}}` property from their profile** to allow for re-entry if they retake the quiz.
                For example:
                ![how to send leads to klaviyo resend email with each quiz retake](/images/how_to_klaviyo_resend_email_with_each_quiz_retake.png)
        5. Save the changes and turn the action `LIVE`.
        This way, each time a quiz taker takes the quiz again, they will be re-added to the segment and will trigger the email flow again.
    ??? tip "Deactive App Emails"
        Remember to deactivate the [email Notifications](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/) from the Quiz Builder once the Klaviyo flow is set up. 
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iIl2njV-UkI?si=ZjTq4oGBKH8ovagW&amp;start=429" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    RevenueHunt app allows you to add contacts from the quiz directly to a list in Klaviyo. 
    1. To do that you‚Äôll need to provide a **Private API Key**.
    2. To create a new Private Key for the RevenueHunt app login to your Klaviyo account.
    3. In account `Settings` open the `API Keys` tab and create a new Private API Key. For list-specific contact additions, you can get your Klaviyo Private API Key [here](https://www.klaviyo.com/account#api-keys-tab).
        ![how to send leads to klaviyo private api key](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_klaviyo_private_api_key.png)
    4. Allow `Full access`.
    5. Copy the private key.
    6. In the Quiz [Connect](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab scroll to Klaviyo and edit the connection.
    7. Paste your Private API Key.
    8. Choose to `mark all profiles as true` and select a list that contacts should be added to.
        !!! warning
            Keep in mind that contacts from the quiz can be added only to a [**Single Opt-in**](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005251108) List in Klaviyo.
    10. Save the changes and publish them with the top-right `Publish` button.
    11. Remember to test the connection with a sample email.
    If you need to modify our Klaviyo email template to match your brand‚Äôs style guide, you‚Äôll need a developer because email templates in Klaviyo are built using HTML, CSS and the [Django templating](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/templates/builtins/) system.
    We send all the responses to the quiz and the recommended products along with the contact information to the customer‚Äôs Klaviyo profile. This information will appear in the customer‚Äôs profile as `custom properties`.
    ![how to send leads to klaviyo customer profile](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_klaviyo_customer_profile.png)
    If you need to add any additional information to the email template, your developer can do so by pulling the appropriate `custom properties` from the user profile.
    In this example, we‚Äôre using our quiz ID `dbqHqN`, which you‚Äôll need to replace for your quiz ID. Here is the code for reference:
    ??? example "Example: Basic Slots Template"
        ```html
        <h3>Hello {{ person|lookup:'Q-dbqHqN ZMiXjj: .Before we get started... what\'s your name?'|default:'' }}!</h3>
        <p>Here we are making sure the product exists:</p>
        {% if person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_image_url' %}
        <p>Cleanser</p>
        <p><img alt="This is the cleanser image" src="{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_image_url'|default:'' }}" /></p>
        <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_name'|default:'' }}</p>
        <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_price'|default:'' }}</p>
        <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_sku'|default:'' }}</p>
        <p><a href="{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_url'|default:'' }}">Buy now</a></p>
        {% endif %}
        {% if person|lookup:'T-dbqHqN: 40s' %}
        <p>You are in your forties</p>
        {% endif %}
        ```
    This example demonstrated that you can not only include custom properties that are passed from the quiz to your Klaviyo account, but you can also use `IF-ELSE` conditional statements to show/hide content based on the customer‚Äôs responses to the quiz.
    !!! note "Note: Counting Products"
        Note that when looping through the products, the **count starts in 0 (zero)**, so for example, if you were to display the name of 3 products in a slot you‚Äôd have to do it like this:
            ```html
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_0_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_1_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_2_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            ```
    Here are some other email templates that you can use as a reference:
    - [Basic Slots Template (4-Step Skincare Routine)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1waa86eP6-Cd7GITOmXbFlvwDC9Nw0JsA/view?usp=sharing) ‚Äì take [this quiz](https://revenuehunt.com/faqs/sending-leads-to-klaviyo-account/#quiz-dbqHqN) & enter your email to see a demo.
    - [Advanced Slots Template (Morning & Night Routine)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HawvV57Z2dma8XFWdRrmeh5DwGTcVyaM/view?usp=sharing) ‚Äì take [this quiz](https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/#quiz-rkHm6Y) & enter your email to see a demo.
    - [Products List Template (Coffee Recommendations)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x33l8q1LZuuzZcQ5F8vZAo8BXjywsGMO/view?usp=sharing) ‚Äì take [this quiz](https://revenuehunt.com/faqs/sending-leads-to-klaviyo-account/#quiz-aMnHBw) & enter your email to see a demo.
    !!! warning "Note: These templates won‚Äôt work as is"
        Bear in mind that these templates (unlike the one generated from the Connect > Klaviyo tab) won‚Äôt work as is. They were created for a sample quiz. Your developer will have to modify the `custom properties` to match the ones that are passed from the quiz to your Klaviyo account. The `quiz ID` is different, so are other property names.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PoLkSjl628o?si=iiIQVsgUgd46BJbu" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    This article explains how to send leads to Mailchimp from your quiz.
    Automating the transfer of quiz leads to your Mailchimp account can help you improve your email marketing campaigns by segmenting your audience and sending them personalized follow-up emails. 
    !!! warning "Important Considerations"
        - **Limited Data Transfer**: Mailchimp integration only supports email, name, and customer tags to be send from the quiz. For more complex emailing/data needs, including direct product recommendations, consider using a different service.
        - **Alternative Services**: For functionality beyond basic data transfer, platforms like [Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/), [HubSpot](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-hubspot/) or [Omnisend](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-omnisend/) are recommended. These services offer more robust integration options for personalized follow-ups.
    Before you begin, ensure you have:
    - An active Mailchimp account.
    - A RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz that you wish to connect with Mailchimp.
    Connecting your quiz to Mailchimp allows for the seamless transfer of leads:
    1. Locate your quiz and click on the [Connect](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab at the top of the interface.
    2. Find the Mailchimp section and click on the `Connect` button. This action will redirect you to a Mailchimp login page in a new tab.
        ![how to send leads to mailchimp authorize1](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_mailchimp_authorize1.png)
    3. Log into your Mailchimp account and authorize the app by clicking on `Allow`.
        ![how to send leads to mailchimp authorize2](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_mailchimp_authorize2.png)
    4. If the connection was successful, you'll see a `Mailchimp got connected, please close this windows to go back to the dashboard.` message.
    4. After authorization, your quiz is connected to Mailchimp, and you can proceed to link it to a specific mailing list.
        ![how to send leads to mailchimp settings](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_mailchimp_settings.png)
    5. Return to the [Connect](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab in your quiz platform. You may need to refresh the page to update the connection status.
    6. Follow the prompts to select the Mailchimp list you wish to send your quiz results to from the dropdown.
    Sometimes, you would like a bit more control over the data that is sent to Mailchimp. In that case there are a few alternatives you can use to send quiz leads to Mailchimp.
    - **Using Shopify Customers**: You can use Shopify Customers to send quiz leads to Mailchimp. Just connect your quiz to Shopify Customers following [this guide](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-shopify-customers/). Then, use a native Shopify - Mailchimp integration to send the quiz leads to Mailchimp.
    - **Using Zapier**: You can use out native Zapier integration to send quiz leads to Mailchimp. Just connect your quiz to Zapier following [this guide](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-zapier/). Then, in Zapier set up a redirection of selected data to Mailchimp.
    - **Using Webhooks**: You can use our Webhooks integration to send quiz leads to Mailchimp. Just connect your quiz to Webhooks following [this guide](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-webhooks/). Then, in Webhooks set up a redirection of selected data to Mailchimp.
    - **Manually adding the quiz leads to Mailchimp**: You can manually add the quiz leads to Mailchimp by uploading a CSV file generated from the quiz [metrics > responses](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) section.
    With [customer tags](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/#customer-tags), you can segment your audience within Mailchimp based on their quiz responses:
    1. Make sure the quiz is connected to Mailchimp. 
    2. Create [customer tags](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/#customer-tags) in the RevenueHunt app and link them to choices.
        ![how to send leads to mailchimp tags](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_mailchimp_tags.png)
    3. Once done, click the `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz with new changes.
    4. Navigate to the `Audience` section in your Mailchimp account.
    5. Use the customer tags to create segmented lists or groups, allowing for targeted campaign efforts based on the quiz outcomes.
    To override Mailchimp's limitation on pushing detailed quiz data, you can use `customer tags` to represent customer responses.
    1. For each possible quiz answer, create a corresponding [customer tag](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/#customer-tags) within your quiz setup. This requires planning to ensure each tag accurately represents the quiz responses.
        ![how to send leads to mailchimp tags](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_mailchimp_tags.png)
    2. Upon completion of the quiz by a participant, Mailchimp will receive all the tags that the customer picked based on their choices.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PoLkSjl628o?si=iiIQVsgUgd46BJbu" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    If you want to set up a post-quiz email flow with Mailchimp, you can follow the steps below:
    1. **Connect Your Quiz to MailChimp.** Follow the instructions in the [Send Quiz Leads to Mailchimp](#send-quiz-leads-to-mailchimp) section.
        !!! tip
            Remember to take a test quiz/preview the quiz leaving a sample email address in order to send first data to MailChimp and test the connection. You can use your real email with a +test1, +test2 to test different answering routes. For example, youremail+test1@email.com or youremail+test2@email.com.
    2. **Use Customer Tags for Segmentation.** Once your quiz is connected you should consider what data you want to send to MailChimp from the quiz. You can, for example:
        - [Create customer tags in your quiz](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/#customer-tags) to represent different quiz responses.
        - Link these tags to specific answers in your quiz.
        - Upon completion of the quiz by a participant, Mailchimp will receive all the tags that the customer picked based on their choices.
        - In MailChimp, you can use these tags to segment your audience and tailor your email campaigns.
        !!! warning
            Mailchimp API only supports email, name, and customer tags to be send from the quiz. To override Mailchimp‚Äôs limitation on pushing detailed quiz data, you can use customer tags to represent customer responses.
    3. **Design Email Campaigns.** Once the quiz answers are covered with customer tags, all the information you need about your customer will start flowing into MailChimp. That‚Äôs when you can set up your email campaigns. 
        - You can start by setting up Automations (automated email flows) to trigger based on specific tags or quiz completions.
        - Then, create different email templates in MailChimp that correspond to different quiz outcomes or automation flows.
        !!! example
            Imagine you run a skincare eCommerce store. Your quiz asks customers about their skin type and concerns. Based on their answers, you tag them as ‚ÄúOily Skin,‚Äù ‚ÄúDry Skin,‚Äù etc.
            In MailChimp, you create an email series targeting these tags. For instance:

# How to Send Leads to Omnisend

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

Apart from giving your customers a personalized product recommendation, you can connect Product Recommendation Quiz to your Omnisend account so that the quiz results are sent automatically to your mailing list. This way you can segment them based on their responses and follow up with targeted campaigns.
    This article explains how to connect your quiz to Omnisend, create a segment for quiz participants and how to send the quiz results via email in Omnisend.
    1. **Add an email question**: Ensure your quiz includes an [**email question**](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#email), as this is essential for sending data to Omnisend. If an email question is missing, you can add one from the `+ Add Question` menu or insert an email block into an existing question.
    2. **Generate Omnisend API Key**: First, you'll have to [generate a new API Key in Omnisend](https://app.omnisend.com/integrations/api-keys). 
        - Log in to your Omnisend account.
        - Go to **Store Settings** > **API** and create a new API key.
        - Name the key (e.g., 'Skincare Basic API Key for Quiz', 'RevenueHunt API Key', etc.) and grant all permissions.
        - Copy the generated API key.
        ![how to send leads to omnisend api key generate](/images/how_to_omnisend_create_api_key.png){:width="500px"}
    3. **Connect to Omnisend**: Access the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and navigate to the [Connect/Integrations](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab. Scroll to the Omnisend section and click on the `Connect` button to initiate the connection process.
    4. In the popup/field that appears, you'll need to enter your `Omnisend API Key` into the input field, then click `Save`.
    5. Update the preview/live quiz with the top-right `Publish` button to save the connection. 
    6. **Preview your quiz**: After connecting to Omnisend, preview your quiz all the way to the results page to send the first contact. Use a sample email (e.g., 'alexa@example.com') and provide sample answers to populate properties in Omnisend.
    7. **Check your profile**: Go back to the Omnisend platform and navigate to the **Dashboard** > **Audience** > **Contacts**. Check if the sample profile (e.g., 'Alexa RevenueHunt / alexa@example.com') has been added. Click on the profile to view all custom properties from the quiz, including: 
        - Quiz answers
        - Recommended products
        - Quiz name
        - Product links, names, and images.
    Following these steps ensures that every time a customer completes your quiz, their contact details, quiz responses, and product recommendations are automatically sent to your Omnisend account. 
    We send all the responses to the quiz and the recommended products along with the contact information to the customer‚Äôs Omnisend profile. This information will appear in the customer‚Äôs profile as `custom properties`.
    ![how to omnisend custom properties](/images/how_to_omnisend_custom_properties.gif)
    If you need to add any additional information to the email template, your developer can do so by [pulling the appropriate custom properties from the user profile](#use-quiz-data-in-omnisend-email-templates).
    It‚Äôs possible to set up a post-quiz email campaign in Omnisend to send the product recommendations or other offers to the quiz participants. 
    Below you‚Äôll find some basic instructions that you can follow to set up an email flow in Omnisend. It covers creating a segment for quiz takers, setting up an automation workflow, and customizing email content with quiz results.
    !!! warning
        Email templates and flows are not something that‚Äôs a one-click install. It should be built by someone with technical knowledge and experience in Omnisend.
        Once the quiz is connected to Omnisend (and the data is sent there), it‚Äôs out of our app‚Äôs scope, and any particular questions on how to set up the flows and how to build the email templates should be directed to Omnisend.
    1. **Connect Your Quiz to Omnisend**: Refer to the instructions provided [here](#link-quiz-to-omnisend) to ensure your quiz is correctly connected to Omnisend.
    2. **Create a Segment for Quiz Participants**: In Omnisend, [create a segment](https://support.omnisend.com/en/articles/1400415-creating-segments) specifically for users who have completed the quiz. This can be done by filtering for a `custom property` that only quiz participants will have, such as `permalink_quiz_id`.
        ![how to omnisend segment](/images/how_to_omnisend_create_segment.png)
        - Use the custom properties to create a segment for users who took the quiz. Select a property (e.g., `permalink_quiz_id`) and copy it.
        - Go to 'Audience' > 'Segments' and create a new segment from scratch.
        - Add a filter using the copied property.
        - Name the segment something recognizable, e.g., 'Skincare Quiz Basic Segment' and save it.
        - Omnisend will automatically add profiles with this property to the segment.
    3. **Set Up an Automated Workflow**: Develop an [automation workflow](https://support.omnisend.com/en/articles/3954813-omnisend-automation-workflow-settings) in Omnisend that triggers when someone is added to the newly created segment of quiz participants. This step involves configuring Omnisend to automatically start the email campaign sequence for users in this segment.
        ![how to omnisend flow](https://loom.com/i/2e3ebc719c764822935b79d68c67456b?workflows_screenshot=true)
        - Navigate to the 'Automation' section in OmniSend.
        - Explore existing workflows or create a new workflow from scratch.
        - Set a trigger for the workflow: select 'When someone enters the segment' and choose the segment you created, e.g., 'Skincare Quiz Basic Segment'.
        - Save the changes to initiate the workflow when users enter the segment.
    4. **Customize the Email Template**: Customizing the email template to include quiz results and product recommendations requires HTML, CSS, and [Django templating](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/templates/builtins/) knowledge. Use Omnisend‚Äôs existing email templates as a base and modify them to incorporate the quiz data as custom properties. Ensure the template aligns with your brand‚Äôs style guide.
        - Drag and drop an email action below the trigger in the workflow.
        - Set the email subject (e.g., 'Your Quiz Results') and add a subheader.
        - Edit the email content as needed, then save changes to access the email editor.
    5. To get you started, you can use the [Sample Quiz Results Email Templates](#email-templates) we provide or [use the custom properties](#use-quiz-data-in-omnisend-email-templates) we sent to your Omnisend account to build your own email template.
    6. **Preview and test the email**: Preview and test the email as one of the segment subscribers. Complete any additional follow-up steps in the workflow.
    7. **Save all changes and start the workflow**: Save all changes and start the workflow to activate the automation for quiz takers.
    You can use the quiz data in your Omnisend email templates by using the `custom properties` that are passed from the quiz to your Omnisend account.
    ![how to omnisend custom properties](/images/how_to_omnisend_custom_properties.gif)
    If you need to add any additional information to the email template, your developer can do so by [pulling the appropriate custom properties from the user profile](https://support.omnisend.com/en/articles/1061885-custom-properties-for-contacts).
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 53.125%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/1911ea75ad7d4531b3886b0fd5af01a7?sid=741a1bb2-72bb-41ee-be1b-390654e18369" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    You can pull the customer answers into an email template by using the `custom properties` that are passed from the quiz to your Omnisend account. This is done by using the `insert personalization tag` feature in Omnisend.
    1. Navigate to your OmniSend automation workflow. Select the email you want to edit. Begin editing the content to create a new template.
    2. Add a text element to your email template. Type a base message, e.g., "You said that your skin feels...".
    3. Access the text block settings to `insert personalization tag`.
    4. Use the personalization tag feature to browse available custom properties from quiz profiles.    
    5. Search for the specific answer related to the quiz question (e.g., `quiz_LKKT6j_answer_qbc_485600ce`).
        ![how to omnisend insert personalization tag](/images/how_to_omnisend_insert_personalization_tag.png){:width="500px"}
    6. Insert the custom property into your text element. You can optionally provide default text. 
        ![how to omnisend personalization tag](https://loom.com/i/69abdc33b47a4321b8b0001e5f1a57ba?workflows_screenshot=true)
    7. Save your changes to the email template.
    8. Use the preview feature to test the template with a specific profile (e.g., Alexa Revenue Hunt). Confirm that the custom property is correctly displayed in the email content, reflecting the user's quiz response.
    9. Save the email template.
    Use the `permalink_koHP8VA` in your email template. This property already contains a full url to the quiz results page.
    !!! example
        `<a href="{{ contact.custom.permalink_koHP8VA }}">View your quiz results</a>`
    Here are some email templates that you can use as a reference:
    - [Basic Slots Template (4-Step Skincare Routine)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wy-_nb0nGyU0_NsWB6YZMiXbXiA2sMyrGu6ks7TqzjQ/edit?usp=sharing)
    - [Advanced Slots Template (Morning & Night Routine)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RIXL2zF0ErGbUX5IwCRXjnr8bNV3wXuZQuuy3NmbL_I/edit?usp=sharing)
    - [Products List Template (Coffee Recommendations)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/175YmJpZ_iTahGFip46MGb6fcn5cupNsCEuZFxMnFCAg/edit?usp=sharing)
    Bear in mind that the templates won‚Äôt work by just copy/pasting. These templates were created for our demo quiz. Your developer will have to modify the `custom properties` in these templates to match the ones that are passed from the quiz to your Omnisend account. The `quiz ID` is different, so are other property names. After the changes are made, your developer can insert the code as a `custom HTML block` on the Omnisend email template.

# How to Send Quiz Leads to Shopify Customers

You can add new customers automatically to your Shopify Customers list every time someone completes the quiz. Once someone leaves their email in the quiz, their Shopify Customer profile will be updated with their name, email, phone number and [customer tags](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/#customer-tags).

This article explains how to connect your quiz to Shopify Customers and build a Shopify Flow targeted at quiz takers.

## Link Quiz to Shopify Customers

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

1. Go to your quiz and click on the [Connect](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab on the top of the screen. This will open a tab where you can connect your quiz with multiple third-party services.
    2. Then click on the `Connect` button in the `Shopify Customers` section. This will authorize our app to connect with your Shopify Customers List.
    3. Click the `Publish` button to save the changes and update the preview/live quiz with new settings.
    Newly captured leads will appear in your Shopify Customers List with their [Customer Tags](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/#customer-tags) added to their profile.
    ![how to send leads to shopify customers customer profile](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_shopify_customers_customer_profile.png)
    !!! note
        If a profile with the same email already exists, it will simply be updated with the customer tags from the quiz.
        Customer tags are updated every time a customer takes the quiz.
    !!! note
        Tags coming from the quiz will have a `prq_` prefix added. So if you created a tag called `teen` in Shopify profile, it will be available as `prq_teen`.
    By default, all the contacts added to the list via the quiz **will be marked as subscribed** and their consent to receiving marketing information was given. You can change that in the email and phone questions settings.
    1. To change the default Consent state and Opt-in level, go to the email or phone question in the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/).
    2. Open the [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).
        ![how_to_send_leads_to_shopify_customers_consent.png](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_shopify_customers_consent.png)
        - Under `Consent state`, you can select either `subscribed` or `non-subscribed`.
        - Under `Opt-in level`, you can select either `confirmed_opt_in` or `single_opt_in` (pick this option if you only want to send the one results email to the customer).
    3. Click the `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz with new settings.
    You can use [Customer Tags](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/#customer-tags) to send quiz answers that the customer provided in the quiz to their Shopify Customer's profile.
    Follow these steps to add tags to your quiz choices and test the setup:
    1. **Adding Tags to Quiz Choices**: To add tags to your quiz choices, follow these steps:
        - Open the Revenue Hunt Quizzes app and select your quiz.
        - Navigate to the [Customer Tags](/reference/quiz-builder/customer-tags/) section.
        - Create new tags for each choice. For example, create a tag called `teen` and assign it to the relevant choice.
        - Repeat this process for other choices, adding appropriate tags as needed (e.g., `30s`, `40s`, `50s`, `60s`, `dry skin`, `oily skin`, etc.).
        - Additionally, add a common tag (e.g., `quiz`) to all choices in one of the questions to identify participants from the product recommendation quiz. Anyone who takes the quiz will be tagged with this common tag.
    2. **Saving Changes**: After adding the desired tags, click `Publish` to save your changes.
    3. **Test the quiz**: `Preview` the quiz using the same or a new email to test the tagging functionality.
    4. **Refresh the Shopify Customers list**: Once participants complete the quiz, refresh the Shopify Customers list to see the leads being added.
    5. **View the customer tags**: Open the profile of a participant to view their name, email, and the associated customer tags from the quiz.
    !!! note
        Tags coming from the quiz will have a `prq_` prefix added. So if you created a tag called `teen` in Shopify profile, it will be available as `prq_teen`.
    ![how to send leads to shopify customers customer profile](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_shopify_customers_customer_profile.png)
    You can then use these tags to [create a Shopify email Flow](#set-up-shopify-automation-flow).
    <iframe class="alignnone size-full" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GcxUgLyZUZc?si=TdE6-D4EAckWkgCj" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">Ôªø</span></iframe>
    ![how to shopify customers automation full cycle](/images/how_to_shopify_customers_automation_full_cycle.png)
    1. To set up a post-quiz automation head to your `Shopify dashboard > Marketing > Automations`, click `View templates`.
    2. Select a `Create custom automation` automation:
        ![/how to send leads to shopify customers automation1](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_shopify_customers_automation1.png)
    3. **Add a trigger**: Click anywhere and select the first trigger to be `Customer created`.
        ![how to send leads to shopify customers automation2](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_shopify_customers_automation2.png)
    4. **Select a condition**: Add a `Condition` action after the trigger. Click `Add variable` and from the list look for `customer` and then `tags`. Then, set up the condition as follows: 
        **At least one customer / tags** `includes` tags_item  `prq_quiz`.
        ![how to send leads to shopify customers automation3](/images/how_to_shopify_customers_flow_add_conditon.gif)
        !!! note
            You need to add the full name of the tag. For example, `prq_oilyskin` or `prq_Oily Skin`.
        ![how to send leads to shopify customers automation4](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_shopify_customers_automation4.png)
    5. **Set up an email**: To send a follow-up email to all the quiz contacts that contain the `prq_ tag`(right after the tag is added to their profile), click `Then > Action` and from the list select `Send marketing email`. Next, select the email template you want to use.
        ![how to send leads to shopify customers automation6](/images/how_to_shopify_customers_flow_add_email.gif)
    6. **Save**: Remember to `Turn on workflow` once you're done with making the changes.
        ![how to shopify customers automation full cycle](/images/how_to_shopify_customers_automation_full_cycle.png)
    Now, all the quiz takers with a specific `prq_ tag` will be sent the marketing email.

# How to Send Leads to Webhooks

Integrating thw quiz with webhooks allows you to automatically send all quiz data, including responses, recommended products, and participant information, to your specified endpoints. 

This guide will walk you through the steps to link your quiz to custom webhooks, enabling instant data integration for further processing or analysis.

Before you start, ensure you have:

- A RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz from which you want to send data.
- A valid webhook URL to receive the data. You can use a service like [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site) to generate a temporary endpoint if you want to test the feature.

## Link Quiz to Webhooks

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

To initiate the integration:
    1. Navigate to the [Connect](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) section of your quiz.
    2. Scroll down to the "Webhooks" option and click on `Connect` to expand the input field.
    3. In the newly opened line, paste your webhook URL. The system will automatically save the URL once entered.
    4. After adding the webhook URL, click on the three dots `‚Ä¶` next to the webhook entry and select `Test webhook` from the dropdown menu.
    5. A successful connection test will result in a message, the appearance of which may vary based on your webhook's configuration.
        ![how to webhook success](/images/how_to_webhook_success.png)
    6. If an error occurs during the test, perform the following checks:
        - Verify that your quiz has received responses by checking the `Metrics -> Responses` section. If no responses are present, generate test responses by selecting `Previewing` it.
        - Confirm the correctness of the webhook URL and its active status.
    7. **Configuring HTTP Headers (Optional)**: For enhanced security or specific data handling requirements, you can add HTTP headers to your webhook.
        1. After a successful connection test, select `+add new header` to open header fields.
        2. Enter the data for your HTTP headers, which will be sent along with the quiz data in a POST request.
    8. **Activating Your Webhook**: With testing and configuration complete, activate your webhook. Use the toggle button next to your webhook entry to activate it. This switch allows for easy deactivation should the need arise.
    Upon activation, all quiz data will be transmitted to your webhook URL via a POST request (including headers).
    ![how to webhook post](/images/how_to_webhook_post.png)
    If you want to add another webhook to the quiz, click `+add new webhook`, paste a new URL and follow the same steps to test and activate it.
    Webhooks will receive all data from the quiz, incluiding:
    - Participant's name, email, and phone number.
    - Details of recommended products.
    - Quiz questions and their respective answers.
    - Tags, quiz permalink, and the permalink to individual quiz responses.
    This data is packaged and sent as a JSON payload in a POST request, ensuring a structured and accessible format for automated processing or integration into other systems.
    ![how to webhook sample](/images/how_to_webhook_sample.png)
    Below is a sample JSON payload sent on the POST request for a skincare quiz:
    ```html

# How to Send Leads to Zapier

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

Automating the transfer of leads from your quizzes to your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system or mailing list not only saves time but also allows for more targeted follow-up campaigns. 
    This guide will walk you through connecting your quiz to Zapier, a platform that enables integration with thousands of apps, including popular CRMs.
    !!! info "Connecting the Quiz to Zapier allows you to:"
        - Send quiz leads to Zapier.
        - Send follow-up emails directly from Zapier.
        - Connect the quiz to other apps (that RevenueHunt does not yet integrate with) and send quiz data to there automatically.
    Before beginning, ensure you have:
    - An active Zapier account.
    - Access to the quiz you wish to connect.
    - Access to your CRM or mailing list platform.
    How to connect the quiz to your CRM via Zapier
    It‚Äôs quite simple to set up:
    1. Head to your quiz and click on the [Connect](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab.
    2. Scroll-down to find Zapier and copy your `Zapier API Key`. You'll need this for the connection process.
        ![how to send leads to zapier api key](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_zapier_api_key.png)
    3. Within the [Connect](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab of your quiz, click on the Zapier `Connect` button. 
    4. On the prompt, select `Accept Invite & Build a Zap` to proceed to Zapier's website.
    5. Once redirected to Zapier, click on `Make a Zap`.
    6. In the Zapier interface, search for "RevenueHunt" (or the quiz platform you're using) and select the version 1.1.1.
    7. Follow the on-screen instructions to continue building your Zap. This process will involve selecting the specific actions and triggers that match how you want your quiz data to be handled.
    **OR**
    Set up the connection via Zapier:
    1. **Add Connection** Go to Zapier > Apps and click `+ Add Connection`.

    Sometimes, you would like a bit more control over the data that is sent to Zapier. In that case there are a few alternatives you can use to send quiz leads to Zapier.
    - **Using Webhooks**: You can use our Webhooks integration to send quiz leads to Zapier. Just connect your quiz to Webhooks following [this guide](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-webhooks/). Then, in Webhooks set up a redirection of selected data to Zapier.
    - **Manually adding the quiz leads to Zapier**: You can manually add the quiz leads to Zapier by uploading a CSV file generated from the quiz [metrics > responses](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) section.
    During the setup, you can check the quiz data that Zapier will receive from the quiz. This includes:
    - Email addresses of quiz participants.
    - Recommended products.
    - Responses to quiz questions.
    ![how to zapier data example2](/images/how_to_zapier_data_example2.png)
    After configuring the triggers, you can test the connection in Zapier's `Test trigger` section to ensure the correct data is being captured.
    ![how to zapier data example1](/images/how_to_zapier_data_example1.png)

# How to Send Result Emails from Your Server Using SMTP

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for sending emails across the internet. By connecting your Product Recommendation Quiz created with Revenuehunt app to an SMTP server, emails are sent from your account instead of revenuehunt, enhancing brand consistency and trust.

!!! tip "Connect your SMTP server to your quiz if:"
    - You're sending result emails to quiz respondents.
    - You're sending emails to a specific email address with notifications about each new quiz completion.

    Connecting your SMTP server to your quiz will allow you to send emails from your own email servers instead of Revenuehunt email servers and is a recommended practice.

## Setting Up SMTP Server Connection

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/4887d06413b84d0098f2c08c49f8ead9?sid=6eac3370-9976-4ea2-81c3-85a0691669a5" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    1. **Access Settings**: Navigate to your quiz dashboard and open the [App Settings](/reference/app-settings/).
    2. **Locate SMTP Settings**: Select the [SMTP tab](/reference/app-settings/#smtp).
        ![how to set up smtp](/images/manual_appsettings_smtp.png)
    3. **Enter SMTP Details**: Fill in your SMTP server details. 
        Fill in the following fields:
        ![how to set up smtp filled in](/images/how_to_smtp_filledin.png)
        - **SMTP From Field**: Enter your email address in the format `name@revenuehunt.com`.
        - **SMTP Server**: Copy the host value from your email provider's configuration (usually in the format `smtp.something`).
        - **Username**: Use the username provided, usually your email address.
        - **SMTP Password**: Enter the password provided by your email provider. Note that some providers may require a special password for SMTP settings.
        - **SMTP Port**: Enter the port number (e.g., `587`) as specified by your email provider's configuration.
        SMTP settings vary by email provider. To find your settings:
        - Search your email provider's documentation for 'SMTP'.
        - Visit [Specific SMTP Configurations](#specific-smtp-configurations) for common email provider instructions.
        - Contact your email provider's support team for assistance.
        !!! note
            If you're not sure how to fill it in, try contacting your email service provider or check their documentation (search for "SMTP" on the documentation page).
    4. **Test and Activate**: Click on `test connection & activate`. If the test is succsefull, from now on all the emails will be sent from your server. 
        If there are errors, please check the [troubleshooting guidelines](#troubleshooting-common-smtp-connection-issues).

# Setting Up Result Emails with Product Recommendation Quiz

Sending result emails to quiz takers can significantly improve your quiz sales by reducing cart abandonmemnt and improving the customer experince. With RevenueHunt app it is possible to set up quiz result emails directly without the need to connect the app to an external CRM service, though this option is also avialble.

This guide covers setting up email results for both [quiz respondents](#email-quiz-results-via-shop-quiz-app) and [administartors](#activate-email-notifications-to-admin) and well as sending results emails via an [external CRM service](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-crm/).

!!! tip "With RevenueHunt app you can:"

    - Send emails to quiz respondents with their quiz answers and results directly from the app.
    - Send emails to a specific email address with notifications about each new quiz completion.


!!! warning

    We recently encountered issues with our previous email provider and switched to a new service. Unfortunately, some emails were affected by this change, and not all messages have been going through as expected. 

    Starting on <b>November 29th, 2024</b>, we kindly ask you to [configure your SMTP settings](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails-from-custom-server/) to continue sending result emails through the app. Notification emails will now be sent from your email address ensuring deliverabilty and consistent branding.



## Email Quiz Results via RevenueHunt app

Result emails can be sent directly from the RevenueHunt app to the email provided by the customer. 

Follow the step by step instructions below to active and edit the result emails sent with the app:

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/59f5f73b491545fe85b6a3aaeb025bf1?sid=e7fd0e9f-c795-460b-969b-5b94226c0876" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    1. **Add Your SMTP Credentials**: Go to [`App Settings > SMTP`](/reference/app-settings/#smtp) and provide your email SMTP credentials. Follow [these instruction](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails-from-custom-server/) to learn how to set this up.
        ![manual_appsettings_smtp](/images/manual_appsettings_smtp.png)
        !!! note
            SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. SMTP is a connection protocol that enables third-party apps (e.g. RevenueHunt) to send emails through your email server.
            When you connect the RevenueHunt app to your SMTP Server, the follow-up emails with the quiz results that are sent to your customers will be sent from your email account.
            <b>If you're unsure what credentials to use, check your email provider's documentation (look for "SMTP") or contact their customer support.</b>
    1. **Add Email Question**: Before you set up your result emails, you need to make sure that the quiz has an email question. To add an email question go to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/).
    2. **Activate Respondent Emails**: Go to [`Notifications > TO RESPONDENT`](/reference/quiz-builder/notifications/#to-respondent) and toggle the `Send email when someone completes the quiz` button to activate the emails.
        ![how to activate to respondent emails](/images/manual_quizbuilder_notifications_torespondent_active.png)
    3. **Edit REPLY-TO**: Choose what email the customers will be able to reply to once they recieve the results.
    4. **Email TO**: If you have more than one email question in your quiz, choose an answer to which email question should be used to send the result emails. If you have only one email question, it will be selected by default.
    5. **Email Subject**: Edit the title of the email that customers will receive. You can use `@` to [recall information](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) such as the customer name or the quiz name in the title field.
    5. **Edit Email Content**: Configure the email your customers will receive. You can choose between a **Basic (text)** email format or **Advanced (HTML)** email format. You can switch between the two by clicking `switch to advanced HTML message` or `switch to basic text message` in the `Email Text Message` field.
        - **Basic text** email template is easy to use. Type the text that you want the customer to see in the `Email Text Message` field. You can personalize the email subject and content. You can add dynamic elements with `@`. Use `@` / [Information Recalls](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) to recall quiz information in the email body. You can recall data such as customer name, email, phone number, quiz name, question responses, recommended products and more. Basic email template does not allow the display of images or color customization but offers maximum deliverability.
        ![how to send result emails basic tempalte](/images/manual_quizbuilder_notifications_torespondent_active_basic.png)
        - **Advanced HTML** email template requires the knowledge of HTML and [Handlebars helpers](https://github.com/helpers/handlebars-helpers) to be edited. Incorporate quiz response metadata like `{{first_name}}` to personalize emails. You can use Handlebars to loop through and display recommended products or customize content based on quiz outcomes. Note that HTML emails are not rendered the same in different email clients and that you should add styles inline, not as classes. You also can‚Äôt add JavaScript code since it won‚Äôt be executed by email clients. Read more about styling Advanced HTML Email temapltes [here](#advanced-html-email-templates).
        ![how to send result emails html template](/images/manual_quizbuilder_notifications_torespondent_active_html.png)
    6. **Publish the changes**: Remember to publish the changes with the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/4f81409e7c704226baa5e7d57d3a5d00?sid=943b1e1b-9aee-4680-af9f-17707623df33" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    1. **Add Your SMTP Credentials**: Go to [`App Settings > SMTP`](/reference/app-settings/#smtp) and provide your email SMTP credentials. Follow [these instruction](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails-from-custom-server/) to learn how to set this up.
        ![manual_appsettings_smtp](/images/manual_appsettings_smtp.png)
        !!! note
            SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. SMTP is a connection protocol that enables third-party apps (e.g. RevenueHunt) to send emails through your email server.
            When you connect the RevenueHunt app to your SMTP Server, the notification emails to admin will be sent from your email account.
            <b>If you're unsure what credentials to use, check your email provider's documentation (look for "SMTP") or contact their customer support.</b>
    1. **Open Notifications**: Navigate to [`Notifications > TO SELF`](/reference/quiz-builder/notifications/#to-self) in your quiz dashboard.
    2. **Activate Notifications**: Toggle the button to activate the emails. Here, you can opt to receive an email for each quiz completion and/or when someone proceeds to the cart or checkout.
        ![how to send resutl emails to self](/images/manual_quizbuilder_notifications_toself_active.png)
    3. Add your email address in the `Send email notification to` field.
    4. **Publish the changes**: Remember to publish the changes with the top-right `Publish` button.
    **Using Metadata**
    Each quiz response has metadata which can be used in your emails to personalize them. You can see the `metadata` from the quiz response on the right hand side of each notification:
    ![how to send result emails metadata](/images/how_to_send_result_emails_metadata.png)
    The metadata from a quiz response can include various details that are useful for personalizing email communications.
    For example:
    - **Show Customer Name**: If you wish to display the respondent‚Äôs name, you can use the `{{first_name}}` handlebar in your code.
        ```html
        <p>Hello {{first_name}},</p>
        ```
        It should render as:
        ```
        Hello Alex,
        ```
    - **Recommended Products in Metadata**: The most recommended products are listed within the metadata JSON under the `products` property.
    **Usign Handlebars**
    You can use Handlebars to add more functionality to your HTML email template.
    For more detailed guidance on using handlebars in your HTML email templates, refer to the following resources:
    - Handlebars Builtin Helpers: [Handlebars Built-in Helpers](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/builtin-helpers.html)
    - GitHub Handlebars Helpers: [Handlebars Helpers on GitHub](https://github.com/helpers/handlebars-helpers)
    The format for helpers in Notifications might slightly differ from those on GitHub. For instance, to truncate a product name to 7 characters, you should write:
    ```handlebars
    {{truncate product.name 7}}
    ```
    If you want to present specific metadata you should use a special property `{{#eq}} ... {{/eq}}`
    - To target all slot blocks:
    ```handlebars
    {{#eq block.type "SlotsBlock"}} ... {{/eq}}
    ```
    - To target a specific block, for example, a block with the ID `A4TeY9`:
    ```handlebars
    {{#eq block.id "A4TeY9"}} ‚Ä¶ {{/eq}}
    ```
    Specific use cases:
    - **List the Recommended Products**: If you want to loop through the most recommended products, you can do so like this:
        ```html
            {{#each products as | product |}}
        <div style="overflow:hidden; margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <img src="{{product.image_url}}" alt="{{product.name}}" width="48" height="48" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px;"/>
        <span style="height:48px;float:left">
        <a href="{{product.url}}" target="_blank">{{product.name}}</a>
        <br>{{product.price}} USD</span>
        </div>
        {{/each}}
        ```
    - **List recommended products with Slot Titles**: If you want to list the most recommended product with Slot titles, you can do so like this:
        ```html
        {{#each blocks as |block|}}
        {{#eq block.type "SlotsBlock"}}
        {{#each block.slots as |slot|}}
        <b>{{slot.title}}</b><br>
        {{#each products as |product|}}
        <div style="overflow:hidden; margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <img src="{{product.image_url}}" alt="{{product.name}}" width="48" height="48" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px;"/>
        <span style="height:48px;float:left">
        <a href="{{product.url}}" target="_blank">{{product.name}}</a>
        <br>{{product.price}} USD</span>
        </div>
        {{/each}}
        {{/each}}
        {{/eq}}
        {{#eq block.type "ProductsBlock"}}
        {{#each block.products as |product|}}
        <div style="overflow:hidden; margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <img src="{{product.image_url}}" alt="{{product.name}}" width="48" height="48" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px;"/>
        <span style="height:48px;float:left">
        <a href="{{product.url}}" target="_blank">{{product.name}}</a>
        <br>{{product.price}} USD</span>
        </div>
        {{/each}}
        {{/eq}}
        {{/each}}
        ```
    - **List recommended products separated by Slot Blocks**: If you want to recommend a Morning and Night slot routine separately you can use the following code. Make sure to change the block IDs (‚ÄúA4TeY9‚Äù and ‚ÄúPPT2PG‚Äù) to the ones in your quiz.
        ```html
        <h3>Let‚Äôs start with your morning routine</h3>
        {{#each blocks as |block|}}
        {{#eq block.id "A4TeY9"}}
        {{#each block.slots as |slot|}}
        <b>{{slot.title}}</b><br>
        {{#each products as |product|}}
        <div style="overflow:hidden; margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <img src="{{product.image_url}}" alt="{{product.name}}" width="48" height="48" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px;"/>
        <span style="height:48px;float:left">
        <a href="{{product.url}}" target="_blank">{{product.name}}</a>
        <br>{{product.price}} USD</span>
        </div>
        {{/each}} 
        {{/each}}
        {{/eq}}
        {{/each}}
        <br>
        <h3>Finish the day with your night routine</h3>
        {{#each blocks as |block|}}
        {{#eq block.id "PPT2PG"}}
        {{#each block.slots as |slot|}}
        <b>{{slot.title}}</b><br>
        {{#each products as |product|}}
        <div style="overflow:hidden; margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <img src="{{product.image_url}}" alt="{{product.name}}" width="48" height="48" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px;"/>
        <span style="height:48px;float:left">
        <a href="{{product.url}}" target="_blank">{{product.name}}</a>
        <br>{{product.price}} USD</span>
        </div>
        {{/each}} 
        {{/each}}
        {{/eq}}
        {{/each}}
        ```

# How to Set Up Multiple Result Pages

With the RevenueHunt app it is possible to set up Multiple Results Pages. To add an extra Results Page to your quiz follow the instructions below.

!!! warning

    Adding multiple results pages increases complexity, may lead to unexpected product recommendations, and can impact quiz loading speed. **For maximum conversions and sales, we recommend using only one results page.**

    However, multiple results pages can be beneficial in certain scenarios:

    - Personalized discounts: Show different discounts (or no discount) based on customer preferences or responses.
    - Email collection strategies: Offer unique results based on whether the customer leaves their email address or not.
    - Simplifying conditional logic: If you have a long list of similar conditional blocks, using multiple results pages can make it easier to organize and manage logic by giving each page a clear name.
    - Special cases: Some businesses, like medical & supplements companies, might use separate results pages to inform customers when they are not eligible for certain products, e.g., "You're not qualified for X due to [specific reason]."

    Carefully consider your quiz goals before enabling this feature to ensure it aligns with your business objectives.

# How to Set Up Fixed Recommendations Quiz

Recommended for quizzes with complex branching. Set up fixed sections with pre-determined products to be shown on the results page. Then add logic to control visibility of each section or results page.

!!! info "Use this method for:"

    - Quizzes that show the same product(s) to everyone regardless of answers
    - Quizzes with multiple very precise outcomes and product recommendations
    - Quizzes with complex branching
    - Quizzes that require a lot of logic conditions and custom text

!!! tip

    If your product matrix looks something like the below, this method is for you.

    ![how to recommend products complex matrix](/images/how_to_recommend_products_complexmatrix.png){width=300px;}


## Always The Same Recommendations

Set up a fixed section with pre-determined products to be shown on the results page regardless of the customer answers.

![how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_fixedrecommendations](/images/how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_fixedrecommendations.png){width=500}

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

!!! note "Legacy Version Workaround"
        The legacy version of the app doesn't have direct support for fixed product recommendations. However, you can use one of these two workarounds to achieve the same result.
    **Option 1: Show the Same Products to Everyone**
    This method makes specific products appear for all customers, regardless of their quiz answers.
    1. Go to the [Link Products section](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) in [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/)
    2. Choose any question in your quiz
    3. Link your desired fixed products to EVERY choice in that question
    4. These products will now receive votes regardless of customer choices
    5. They will appear at the top of the Results Page due to having the most votes
    **Option 2: Create a Dedicated Fixed Products Section**
    This method lets you combine dynamic recommendations with fixed products by creating a separate product block.
    1. **Create a Collection for Fixed Products** - Create a new collection in Shopify with the products you want to always show. *For example: "Essential Products" or "Featured Items"*
    2. **Sync Your Store**
        - Go to [Success Checklist](/reference/dashboard/#success-checklist) in the app
        - Click `Sync Catalog` to update your catalog
    3. **Link the Collection**
        - Go to [Link Products](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) in [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/)
        - Select any question in your quiz
        - Link your new collection to EVERY choice
        - This ensures these products always get votes
    4. **Set Up the Results Page**
        - Add two separate Blocks to your [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/):
            1. Product Block: Shows dynamic recommendations based on quiz answers.
            2. Slot Block: Shows most voted products from the collection thats linked to the Slot. Make sure to customize the Block title, description and in the Included Collections field, link the newly created collection. Ajust how many products to display.
    5. **Test Your Setup**
        - Save and preview the quiz
        - Take the quiz multiple times with different answers
        - Verify that:
            - Dynamic recommendations change based on answers
            - Fixed products always appear in their dedicated Slot
    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add a `Multiple choice question` asking the customer about their skin type: Dry, Normal, Oily, or Combination-type skin. 
        !!! tip
            Use the description box in `Question Settings -> Show Description` to help customers determine their skin type.
    2. **Add Content Blocks to Results Page**: Go to the Results Page and add a new `content block`. To add a content block click the `+` sign and select `Content Block` from the list. Add multiple content blocks describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:
        !!! example
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness ‚Äì we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that's deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn't experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin's natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
        !!! tip    
            Make the heading stand out with [markdown language](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/). Use the`#` sign before a sentence can make it bold.
    3. **Add Display Logic**: If we don't add [Display Logic](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/) to the quiz, our blocks will just appear one after the other on the Results Page, regardless of the choice we made. To add Display Logic, select a content block and click on `display logic`. Next, click `add display logic`. Set up IF-THEN statements to control when each content block should be visible or hidden based on the customer's choices.
        ![how to hide content with logic display logic statement](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_display_logic_statement.png)
    4. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.
    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add your `Multiple choice questions` asking the customer about their needs. 
        !!! tip
            Use the description box in `Question Settings -> Show Description` to help customers determine their skin type.
    2. **Create Multiple Results Pages**: In the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) tab, click on the `+` sign to add additional results pages. Create a separate results page for each result (for example, based on skin type (Dry, Normal, Oily, Combination)).
        !!! tip
            Check this article [Set Multiple Result Pages](/how-to-guides/set-multiple-result-pages/) to learn how to set up multiple results pages.    
    3. **Add Content to Each Results Page**: For each results page, add content blocks describing the specific skin type and its challenges and a Product Block. For example:
        !!! example
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness ‚Äì we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that's deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn't experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin's natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
    4. **Branch your quiz**: Use Jump Logic to branch your quiz and **link the recommended produsts to the choices in the last question on each branch**.
        Stage 1:
        ![how to recommend products complex matrix logic tree](/images/how_to_recommend_products_complexmatrix_logictree.png)
        Stage 2:
        ![how to recommend products complex matrix logic tree](/images/how_to_shopifyv_fixedrecommendationquiz_mrp_branching.png)
    5. **Set Up Jump Logic**: Go to the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab and set up Jump Logic to direct customers to the appropriate results page based on their choices.
        ![how to recommend products complex matrix logic tree](/images/how_to_shopifyv_fixedrecommendationquiz_mrp_resultsjumps.png)
        !!! tip
            For each choice in your skin type question, create a Jump Logic rule that directs to the corresponding results page.
    6. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.

# How to Set Up Funnel Quiz

A Funnel Quiz helps your customers find the best product by assigning "votes" to products as they answer questions. The quiz counts these votes and recommends the most relevant products at the end.

!!! info "Use this method for:"

    - Helping customers narrow down a large product catalog
    - Most quizzes, especially product finders
    - Your first product recommendation quiz
    - Quizzes without complex branching


## ‚úçüèª Voting System

Our product recommendation algorithm works like a voting system:

- Product variants are linked to each choice.
- When a customer picks a choice, all linked products receive one vote.
- After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted product variants sorted by the number of votes.
- If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty.
- If there's a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the order of products.

**Understand Inclusion and Exclusion**

### Inclusion
Products or collections added in the `include/upvotes` field of the [Link Products/Collections/Upvote](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) tab are upvoted in the final recommendations.

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

![how to recommend products inclusion](/images/how_to_recommend_products_inclusion.png)
    How the votes work for each included linked item:
    - **Product variants**: Individual variants receive a vote when their linked choice is selected. Note that only product variants are directly linked to choices. However, on the results page, variants can be grouped under their parent products for a streamlined shopping experience.
    - **Collections**: Every product within a linked collection receives a vote when their linked choice is selected.
    - **Tags**: Every product within a linked tag receives a vote when their linked choice is selected.
    - **Variant collections**: Created automatically by the app, every product within a linked variant collection receives a vote when their linked choice is selected.
    - **Vendor collections**: Created automatically by the app, every product within a linked vendor collection receives a vote when their linked choice is selected.
    - **All variants of the same product at once**: All variants of a product get upvoted at once when their linked choice is selected. Note: A special setting called `Use top-level product` in [Quiz Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/) needs to be active for this option to appear in the Link Products section.
    ![how to recommend products exclusion](/images/how_to_recommend_products_exclusion.png)
    RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz can show on the results page **product variants**, **main products** and **[Recharge subscription products](/how-to-guides/recommend-subscription-products/)**. 
    RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz **cannot recommend collections** of products, though it's possible to [only recommend products from a specific collection](/how-to-guides/recommend-skincare-routine-slots/).
    Follow these steps to set up product recommendations in your Product Recommendation Quiz:
    1. **Link Products to Choices**: Navigate to the [Link Products/Collections/Upvote](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) tab within your quiz setup. For each choice, link/upvote relevant products. 
        - You can link./upvote product variants, collections, tags, variant collections, vendor collections or all variants of the same product at once.
    2. **Edit the Results Page**: In the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) tab you can edit the content of your results screen. You can add a heading, content block, image block, HTML block, Product Block or a Product Slot block. 
        !!! tip
            Check [How to Edit the Results Page](/how-to-guides/edit-results-page/) for more information.
    3. **Add a Product Block**: Products can be displayed on the Results Page as a list via the `Product Block` or divided into slots via the `Product Slot Block`. For beginners, it's recommended to use a `Product Block` to show the recommendations.
        - **Product Block** displays the products sorted by the number of votes - the most voted products are shown first, and the least voted last. In [Product Block settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) you can **choose how many products you want to show** at the end of the quiz.
            ![how to recommend products product block](/images/how_to_recommend_products_product_block.png){width="500"}
        - **Product Slot Blocks** allow you to display the products in clear steps, for example as a skincare routine. Each Product Slot will recommend the most-voted product from a collection that's linked to it. *Check [How to Recommend a Skincare Routine with Slots](/how-to-guides/recommend-skincare-routine-slots/) for step-by-step instructions on how to set up Slot Blocks.* 
            ![how to recommend products slots block](/images/how_to_recommend_products_slots_block.png)
    4. **Test the Results**: After your products are linked and the results page is set up, you can test your quiz.
        - Click [`Publish/Save`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) on the top-right menu to update the preview/live quiz. 
        - Then, click [`Preview`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) to test the quiz you've created in a new window. 
            !!! note
                You can test the quiz as much as you like as long as you always open a new preview window. These test responses done as admin are automatically removed after 1 hour to not add to your usage quota.
    5. **Troubleshoot the Results**: Use the quiz's [built-in search tool](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) in the `Responses` section to understand why specific products were recommended or missing from the recommendations. 
        !!! tip
            Check [How to Troubleshoot Quiz Results](/how-to-guides/troubleshoot-product-results/) for detailed instructions on how to use this tool.
    6. **Refine the Results**: If you want to make the results ultra-precise, you can also:
        - **Limit the recommendations**: You can choose to limit the recommendations to only show products that received X votes or more in the [Results Page settings](/how-to-guides/only-recommend-products-with-minimum-votes/).
        - **Use Exclusions**: You can use [Exclusions](#exclusion) to make sure that unwanted products are not shown (even if they were upvoted in another choice earlier).
    By linking product variants and collections to quiz choices, and understanding the inclusion/exclusion logic, you can use our algorithm to offer precise product recommendations.

    </div>
    Follow these steps to set up a funnel quiz with product slots in Shopify:
    **Step 1: Understand Recommendation Mechanism**
    Our product recommendation algorithm works like a voting system:
    - Products are linked to each choice
    - When a customer picks a choice, all linked products receive one vote
    - After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted products sorted by the number of votes
    - If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty
    - If there's a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the order of products
    You can also:
    - Limit the recommendations to only show products that received X votes or more in the [Results Page settings](/how-to-guides/only-recommend-products-with-minimum-votes/)
    - Use Exclusions to make sure that unwanted products are not shown (even if they were upvoted in another choice earlier)
    **Step 2: Organize Products into Collections**
    To group products into slots, create new collections in your Shopify store:
    1. Identify your product categories (e.g., Cleansers, Toners, Serums, Moisturizers)
    2. [Create a collection in your Shopify store](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/collections) for each category
    3. Add relevant products to each collection (e.g., all cleansers in the Cleansers collection)
    4. Perform a [catalog sync](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/) to update RevenueHunt with your collections
    ![how to recommend slots cleansers collection](/images/how_to_recommend_slots_cleansers_collection.png)
    **Step 3: Build the Quiz**
    1. Go to the app's [dashboard](/reference/dashboard/) and click [`add new quiz`](/reference/dashboard/#new-quiz)
    2. Choose a pre-defined template (like Basic or Advanced Skincare Quiz) or start from scratch
    3. Name your quiz (can be edited later)
    4. In the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/), add questions by clicking `+ Add question`
    5. Select appropriate [question types](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-types) for your quiz flow
    **Step 4: Link Products to Choices**
    1. Navigate to [Link Products](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) or [Link Collections/Categories](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/) tab
    2. Link relevant product variants or collections to each choice
    3. Ensure every choice has at least one product or collection linked
    ![how to recommend slots link products](/images/how_to_recommend_slots_link_products.png)
    **Step 5: Add Product Slots to the Results Page**
    1. Go to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) tab
    2. Add design elements (headings, logos, content blocks)
    3. Click the `+` button to add a `Product Slots Block`
    4. In the [`Slot Block settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings):
        - Add a slot for each step in the skincare routine
        - Add title and description for each slot
        - Link corresponding product collections to each slot in the `Include` section
        - Choose how many products to recommend per slot (typically one product)
    ![how to recommend slots slot block](/images/how_to_recommend_slots_slot_block.png)
    **Step 6: Test and Troubleshoot**
    1. Click [`Publish/Save`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) to update the preview/live quiz
    2. Click [`Preview`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) to test in a new window
    3. Use the quiz's [built-in search bar](/how-to-guides/troubleshoot-product-results/) in `Metrics > Responses` to troubleshoot recommendations
    4. Test responses as admin are automatically removed after 1 hour
    RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz can use skip logic to show different follow-up questions based on customer choices. The quiz can skip irrelevant questions based on user selections, improving engagement and relevance.
    Follow these steps to set up a funnel quiz with skip logic:
    1. **Create Initial Question**: Create a multiple-choice question about the user's main concerns:
        - Open the RevenueHunt Quiz Builder and create a new quiz
        - Add a multiple-choice question asking about main concerns (e.g., skin concerns)
        - Add options such as Acne, Pigmentation, Blackheads, Flaky Skin
        - Enable 'Allow Multiple Selection' to let users select more than one option
    2. **Add Follow-Up Questions**: For each main concern, add corresponding follow-up questions:
        - Create a question for each option (e.g., Acne, Pigmentation, etc.)
        - Ensure follow-up questions are set up in the same order as the options in the initial question
        - Customize each follow-up question to be relevant to its specific concern
    3. **Set Up Skip Logic**: Configure conditional logic for each follow-up question:
        - Navigate to the Conditional Logic tab for each follow-up question
        - Add rules to skip questions if the corresponding concern was not selected
        - For example: If 'Skin Concerns' is not 'Acne', skip the Acne questions
        - Repeat for each follow-up question and corresponding concern
    4. **Link Products to Choices**: Navigate to the [Link Products](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) tab within your quiz setup:
        - For each choice, link relevant products/variants
        - The quiz will count votes only from questions that were shown to the user
    5. **Test the Quiz Logic**: After setting up questions and skip logic:
        - Click [`Publish/Save`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) on the top-right menu to update the preview/live quiz
        - Click [`Preview`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) to test the quiz in a new window
        - Select multiple concerns to verify that only relevant follow-up questions are displayed
        - Repeat with different selections to ensure the logic works correctly
    6. **Troubleshoot the Results**: Use the quiz's [built-in search tool](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) in the `Responses` section if needed:
        - Check why specific questions were shown or skipped
        - Verify that product recommendations match user selections
    By using skip logic, your quiz will only show relevant questions based on customer choices, creating a more personalized experience and more accurate product recommendations.
    Follow these steps to set up a branching funnel quiz in Shopify:
    **Step 1: Understand Recommendation Mechanism**
    Our product recommendation algorithm works like a voting system:
    - Products are linked to each choice
    - When a customer picks a choice, all linked products receive one vote
    - After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted products sorted by the number of votes
    - If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty
    - If there's a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the order of products
    **Step 2: Build Quiz Structure**
    1. Go to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and create all questions needed for each branch
    2. Add all possible choices for each question
    3. Don't worry about the order yet - you'll set that up with Jump Logic
    **Step 3: Set Up Branching**
    1. Navigate to the Conditional Logic tab for each question
    2. Add Jump Logic rules to create branches:
        - Format: "If answer to Question X is Y, jump to Question Z"
        - Example: If "What's your skin type?" is "Oily", jump to "Oily Skin Concerns"
    3. Ensure each branch's final question leads to:
        - An email/phone collection question, or
        - The results page
    **Step 4: Link Products**
    1. Go to [Link Products](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) tab
    2. For each choice in every branch:
        - Link relevant products/variants
        - Link appropriate collections
    3. The quiz will only count votes from questions shown to the user
    **Step 5: Configure Results Page**
    1. Add a Product Block to display recommendations
    2. Set the number of products to show
    3. Optionally, arrange products into slots for structured recommendations
    4. Configure any additional display settings
    **Step 6: Test and Launch**
    1. Click "Publish/Save" to update the quiz
    2. Test each branch thoroughly:
        - Try all possible paths
        - Verify correct questions appear
        - Check product recommendations
    3. Use the [Response Analysis tool](/how-to-guides/troubleshoot-product-results/) to verify logic
    Follow these steps to set up a funnel quiz with custom text blocks in Shopify:
    **Step 1: Understand Recommendation Mechanism**
    Our product recommendation algorithm works like a voting system:
    - Products are linked to each choice
    - When a customer picks a choice, all linked products receive one vote
    - After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted products sorted by the number of votes
    - If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty
    - If there's a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the order of products
    **Step 2: Build Quiz Structure**
    1. Go to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and create all questions needed.Add all possible choices for each question.
    **Step 3: Link Products to Choices**
    1. Navigate to the [Link Products](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) tab
    2. For each choice link relevant products, varaints or collections.
    3. The quiz will count votes from all questions
    **Step 4: Configure Results Page**
    1. Add a Product Block to display recommendations. Set the number of products to show.
    3. Add multiple content blocks, image or HTML blocks with text for different answer combinations.
    **Step 5: Set Up Display Logic**
    1. For each content block, add display logic rules:
        - Format: If the answer to *Question 1* is *Choice A* **AND** If the answer to *Question 2* is *Choice B* **AND** If the answer to *Question 3* is *Choice C* **OR** If the answer to *Question 1* is *Choice A* **AND** If the answer to *Question 2* is *Choice B* **AND** If the answer to *Question 3* is *Choice D*, then this block is **shown/hidden**.
        - You can combine multiple conditions with AND/OR operators
        - Example: If "Skin Type" is "Oily" **AND** "Main Concern" is "Acne", show skincare routine for oily, acne-prone skin
    2. Ensure all possible answer combinations are covered!
    **Step 6: Test and Launch**
    1. Click "Publish/Save" to update the quiz
    2. Test thoroughly! Try different answer combinations. Verify correct content blocks appear.
    3. Use the [Response Analysis tool](/how-to-guides/troubleshoot-product-results/) to verify logic and check product recommendations.

## ‚úçüèª Voting System


Recommended for most quizzes. The voting system counts product "votes" based on customer quiz choices and recommends products with the highest votes.

!!! note "Use this method for:"  

    - Helping customers narrow down a large product catalog
    - Most quizzes, especially product finders
    - Your first product recommendation quiz
    - Quizzes without complex branching

### Funnel Quiz

The voting system counts product "votes" based on customer quiz choices and recommends products with the highest votes.

![how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_funnel](/images/how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_funnel.png){width=500}

Product recommendation algorithm works like a voting system:

- Product variants are linked to each choice.
- When a customer picks a choice, all linked products receive one vote.
- After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted product variants sorted by the number of votes. *If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty. If there's a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the order of products.*
- You can limit recommendations to a specific number of products or a minimum vote threshold.

!!! tip "How to set this up?"

    Check out the [‚úçüèª Voting System (Funnel Quiz)](/how-to-guides/set-up-funnel-quiz/#funnel-quiz) guide.

### Funnel Quiz with Slots

The voting system counts product "votes" based on customer quiz choices and then recommends highest voted products based on a filter added to each slot. For example, you can recommend a full skincare routine with a quiz that takes into account the customer answers and shows the most voted cleanser, toner, serum and moisturizer arranged into specific slots. 

![how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_funnel_with_slots](/images/how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_funnel_with_slots.png){width=500}

Scoring system is not available in the legacy version of the RevenueHunt app for Shopify. Your developer can implement a custom scoring system with JavaScript on the Results Page instead.    
    !!! tip 
        Check this article to learn how to add custom JavaScript to the Results Page: [How to Add Custom JavaScript to the Results Page](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/).

    !!! tip 
        Check this article to learn how to add custom JavaScript to the Results Page: [How to Add Custom JavaScript to the Results Page](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/).
    Alternatively, your developer can also try this setup:
    ??? question "Do I need advanced technical skills to set this up?"
        While the process isn‚Äôt entirely plug-and-play, with the assistance of a developer, it‚Äôs manageable. If you‚Äôre not familiar with JavaScript or CSS, seeking developer help is advisable.
    **How do I recommend products based on the number of user choices?**
    The recommendation process is based on how many choices the user selects out of the given set. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide:
    1. **Create collections/categories**. Create distinct collections for each group of products you wish to recommend, e.g., ‚Äú1/10 choices selected,‚Äù ‚Äú2/10 choices selected,‚Äù etc.
    2. **Add hidden choices**. In your final question, include a multiple-choice option that correlates with the aforementioned collections/categories. This ensures that each choice connects to its respective recommended collection/category. Make sure to hide these choices from the user with custom CSS code.
    3. **Add custom JavaScript**. Using custom JavaScript, evaluate the choices selected throughout the quiz and write a piece of code that automatically selects one of the hidden choices in the last question. This will determine which product collection/category to recommend based on the number of choices the user made.
    **How can I ensure that users don‚Äôt see the choices in the last question?**
    You can hide these technical choices in the last question using custom CSS code. A guide on how to customize the quiz design can be found [here](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/).
    **Where do I input the custom JavaScript code?**
    [This article](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) explains how to add custom JavaScript code to quiz questions. For example:
    ![recommend-products-based-on-number-of-user-choices image1](/images/recommend-products-based-on-number-of-user-choices_image1.png){width=500}
    The custom JavaScript code should be integrated into the final question to assess the user‚Äôs choices and click the right choices in order to recommend a product collection accordingly.
    **How can I identify the selected choices from each slide or question with JavaScript?**
    To review the values or choice IDs selected for each slide/question, you can use the JavaScript console and search for the values:
    ![recommend-products-based-on-number-of-user-choices image2](/images/recommend-products-based-on-number-of-user-choices_image2.png)

# How to Show Quiz Answers in the Shopify Orders

It's possible to know exactly which orders in your Shopify Orders tab come from the quiz.

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

1. Make sure your quiz is connected to [Shopify Customers](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-shopify-customers/) and that you've [enabled Order Notes](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/themes-by-shopify/vintage-themes/customizing-vintage-themes/get-more-information-with-order-notes) in your Shopify Theme.
    2. To activate Shopify Orders Tagging option navigate to the `Connect` tab in the quiz and scroll down to find `Shopify Orders Tagging` tab.
    3. To allow the quiz to add tags and question answers to your orders, simply click `connect`.
    4. Make sure to `Publish` the quiz in the top right corner.
    From that moment all the orders under the Shopify Orders list will display a small `Notes` section with the tags related to the quiz.
    ![how to show quiz answers on orders example1](/images/how_to_show_quiz_answers_on_orders_example1.png)
    You can freely edit the content of that section by clicking `Edit` and adding your changes.
    ![how to show quiz answers on orders example3](/images/how_to_show_quiz_answers_on_orders_example3.png)
    !!! warning
        Some Shopify themes disable the passing of tags to the orders. These themes should have the option to activate this feature in the theme settings manually.
    !!! warning
        Shopify Revenue Tracking and Orders Tagging only works if the customer adds the products to the cart directly from the quiz results page **AND** if they immediately proceed to the cart after the quiz, and then right away complete the purchase. If they purchase at a later date, this revenue will not be attributed to the quiz anymore.
        Make sure your Results Page Checkout settings are correctly set to `proceed to cart` (not `proceed to checkout` or `link to product`). To change your checkout settings, check [this guide](/how-to-guides/change-checkout-settings/).
    If you believe the orders tagging is not working as it should, try to following steps:
    1. Go to the `Connect` tab and disconnect the quiz from **Shopify Customers** and **Shopify Orders Tagging**. Then, publish the changes with the top-right `Publish` button. 
    2. Connect the quiz again to these tools and (again) publish the changes with the top-right `Publish` button. That should reset the connection.
    3. Use a different browser or incognito browsing mode to open the live quiz on your site (don't test on preview/admin.revenuehunt).
    4. Take the quiz all the way to the results, provide the same email in the quiz that will be used for checkout/placing an order. Good idea is using *yourrealemail+test1@youremail.com* for example. 
    5. Add all the products to cart and proceed to cart, then checkout.
    6. Place a valid test order (as explained [here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/checkout-settings/test-orders)).
    7. Check if the lead was added to **Shopify Customers** section and if it was marked with `RevenueHunt` in the details.
    8. Go to **Shopify Orders** and check if the order notes appear along the test order placed. 
    If you're still having issues, please reach out to our [support team](/how-to-guides/contact-customer-support/).

    Shopify has announced that they‚Äôll be sunsetting all Shop Minis app integrations, including our Shop Minis app.

Shopify's new mobile commerce app, [Shop](https://shop.app/), represents a significant leap forward in enhancing the online shopping experience, offering both Android and iOS users a personalized and streamlined path to discovering and purchasing products from Shopify-powered stores. 

We're excited to inform you that our [RevenueHunt app](https://revenuehunt.com/product-recommendation-quiz-shopify/) has been selected as the **premier quiz solution** for Shop, designed to integrate seamlessly and contribute to a more engaging customer journey.

## Availability and Automatic Integration

Initially, the integration of the RevenueHunt Product Recommendation QUiz will be available to a select group of merchants. We are working towards making this feature broadly available to all eligible merchants soon.

For merchants who meet specific criteria, the Shop App feature will be enabled automatically, making the integration process hassle-free:

!!! info "Eligibility Criteria for Automatic Activation"

    - Your quiz recommends products listed for sale in the Shop app.
    - The quiz does not require an email address as a mandatory field. Optional email collection is permitted.
    - Your quiz does not include a phone number collection question, in line with Shop's guidelines.

## Managing Your Quiz in Shop app

If the Shop App feature has not been activated for your store automatically, you can manually set it up through the [App Settings](/reference/app-settings/). 

1. **Open App Settings**: Navigate to the [`Shop App`](/reference/app-settings/#shop-app-beta) menu within the [App settings](/reference/app-settings/#shop-app-beta) to get started.
  ![how to show quiz in shop app settings](/images/manual_appsettings_shopapp_preview.png)
2. **Select Quiz**: To control which quiz is presented to your customers in the Shop app, simply select your preferred quiz from the dropdown menu. The selected quiz will automatically be set as the default for display in the Shop app.
3. **Mark as default**: The quiz that appears in your Shop store is the one **marked as default**. You can easily identify the default quiz by looking for a small star icon in the top right corner of the quiz's icon on the dashboard. 
    
    ![how to show quiz in shop app select quiz](/images/how_to_show_quiz_in_shop_app_select_quiz.webp)
    
4. **Change default quiz**: To set a quiz as the default, use the quizzes dropdown menu on the dashboard.
    
    ![how to show quiz in shop app mark as default](/images/how_to_show_quiz_in_shop_app_mark_as_default.webp)


!!! warning

    We strive to offer a seamless and comprehensive user experience with the Shop App integration. However, it's important to note that currently, the **collection of phone numbers via the Shop app quiz is not supported**. We are actively working to include this feature in the near future.

# How to Show Quiz on a Customer Profile

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

Integrating quiz results into a customer's profile on your Shopify store can personalize the shopping experience. 
    This guide will walk you through the steps to show the quiz on a customer profile in Shopify.
    !!! warning
        This guide is meant for developers and Shopify Partners. If you're not familiar with Shopify liquid, it is advised to ask for help from a professional to implement this. You can find/hire a developer [here](https://experts.shopify.com/).
    !!! note
        This method works only for Shopify accounts using our [RevenueHunt](https://revenuehunt.com/product-recommendation-quiz-shopify/) app. Unfortunately, we don't have a solution yet on how to show the quiz on a customer profile in WooCommerce, Magento or BigCommerce.
    **Step 1: Connect Your Quiz to Shopify's Customer List**
    To ensure quiz results are associated with the correct customer profile, the first step involves linking your quiz tool with [Shopify's Customer List](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-shopify-customers/). Follow the instructions in [this article](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-shopify-customers/) to check if the quiz was connected correctly.
    **Step 2: Edit the customers/account.liquid File**
    When a respondent completes the quiz, we will send a `metafield` to their profile, which includes the `response/recommendations` they just got.
    When you navigate to Your `Shopify Theme -> Actions -> Edit code`, you can find this metafield within the Templates liquid code of the customer profile:
    ```html
    customer.metafields.prq.response_permalink
    ```
    This is how it looks like within customer/account.liquid file in Shopify:
    ![how to show quiz on customer profile](/images/how_to_show_quiz_on_customer_profile.png)
    **Step 3: Embed the Quiz Results**
    To render the whole results page within an iframe on a profile,  you will need to first embed our `embed.js` file (as you can see on line 67):
    ```html
    <script src="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/embed.js" async></script>
    ```
    Then, [generate an embed code](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-inline/#embedding-an-inline-quiz-on-a-new-page) from the [Share](/reference/quiz-builder/share-publish/) section of the quiz and insert the quiz iframe code (as you can see on line 68):
    ```html
    <iframe src="{{ customer.metafields.prq.response_permalink }}" style="width:100%; border: none; margin-bottom: 30px; position: absolute; left: 0;" />
    ```
    Here‚Äôs how it can look on your customer‚Äôs profile:

# How to Show Quiz Only to Logged-in Customers

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

It‚Äôs possible to use the customer metafields to render quiz results onto different elements of your Shopify Theme liquids. This article explains how to show the quiz only to logged-in customers in Shopify.
    !!! warning
        This guide is meant for developers and Shopify Partners. If you're not familiar with Shopify liquid, it is advised to ask for help from a professional to implement this. You can find/hire a developer [here](https://experts.shopify.com/).
    !!! note
        This method works only for Shopify accounts using our [RevenueHunt](https://revenuehunt.com/product-recommendation-quiz-shopify/) app. Unfortunately, we don't have a solution yet on how to do this in WooCommerce, Magento or BigCommerce.
    **Step 1: Create a New Page Template**
    1. In your `Online Store > Themes` section, head to `Actions > Edit Code`.
    2. Create a new Page template. 
        - Template type: `liquid`. 
        - Template name: `quiz`.
    ![how to show quiz to logged in customers template](/images/how_to_show_quiz_to_logged_in_customers_template.png)
    **Step 2: Add New Page Code**
    Replace your new `page.quiz.liquid` code for the following code and adapt the texts to your store:
    ```html
    <div class="page-width">
    <div class="grid">
    <div class="grid__item medium-up--five-sixths medium-up--push-one-twelfth">
    <div class="section-header text-center">
    <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    </div><div class="grid myaccount">
    {% if customer %}
    <div class="grid__item rh-inline" style="margin: 60px 0 120px;">
    <script src="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/embed.js" async></script>
    {% if customer.metafields.prq.response_permalink %}
    <h2>Your Profile</h2>
    <iframe src="{{ customer.metafields.prq.response_permalink }}" style="width:100%; border: none; margin-bottom: 30px; position: absolute; left: 0;" />
    {% else %}
    <h2>Take our Quiz to determine your skincare routine</h2>
    <iframe src="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/dbqHqN" style="width:100%; border: none; margin-bottom: 30px; position: absolute; left: 0;" />
    {% endif %}
    </div>
    {% else %}
    <div class="w-100"><h3>You're not logged in.</h3></div>
    <div class="w-100"><p>Please <a href="https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/account/login">log in</a> or <a href="https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/account/register">sign up</a> to take the quiz.</p></div>
    {% endif %}
    </div>
    </div>
    </div>
    </div>
    ```
    Remember to replace the URL sections in the code with the correct URLs to the quiz and your website, respectively.
    **Step 3: Apply the theme to the page**
    1. Go to `Online Store > Pages` and click on the `Add Page` button. 
    2. Add the title, then select the `quiz` Theme template.
        ![how to show quiz to logged in customers new page](/images/how_to_show_quiz_to_logged_in_customers_new_page.png)
    3. Click on `Save`.
    The result should look something like this: [https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/pages/logged-in-quiz](https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/pages/logged-in-quiz). 
    - If you‚Äôre not logged in, you‚Äôre prompted to log in or sign up. 
    - If you‚Äôre logged in, you‚Äôre either shown the results page (if you already took the quiz) or the quiz‚Äôs start page.

# How to Show Results Explanation

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/c4cb6bce39a447cc860f8408adade0f4?sid=967d38f5-9c4b-47b0-b73d-41a2aae156d6" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    While our [product recommendation algorithm](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/) works to recommend specific products, it will not automatically display an explanation of **why** a certain product was recommended. It also won‚Äôt automatically display custom text depending on the recommended product.
    The legacy version of the RevenueHunt app **doesn't** have a linear score feature (as in every time a customer picks a choice, the "score" will receive one point and at the end, based on that score, different results pages will be displayed). For this reason, it can be very hard to build a **"personality-type"** quiz with our solution.
    If you want to show different text results depending on the recommended products, this functionality has to be built on the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/). There are a few ways to achieve it:
    1. **Information Recalls/Content Dynamic Source**: Use [Information Recalls/Content Dynamic Source](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) to display a customer's answers within a content block or a text block on the Results Page. This method helps customers understand the rationale behind each product recommendation without any coding or complex logic.
    2. **Display Logic**: [Display Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#display-logic) allows you to show or hide text on the Results Page based on the customer's quiz responses. This method is suitable for shorter, simpler quizzes. For detailed guidance on setting up Display Logic, see [here](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/). 
        !!! tip
            For longer, more complex quizzes, we advise using the custom JavaScript approach for optimal flexibility.
        ??? question "How to Build a Personality-Type Quiz?"
            Imagine you want to determine a customer‚Äôs skin type. You might ask them specific questions about their skin to narrow down their unique characteristics. Here‚Äôs an example:
            ---
            **Step 1: Add Questions to the Quiz**
            **Question 1: Oiliness**  
            *"How does your skin usually feel by the middle of the day?"*  
            - **Very oily, shiny all over.** *(Oily skin)*  
            - **Oily in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin), but dry elsewhere.** *(Combination skin)*  
            - **Balanced, not too oily or dry.** *(Normal skin)*  
            - **Dry and tight all over.** *(Dry skin)*  
            **Question 2: Sensitivity**  
            *"How does your skin react to new products or environmental changes?"*  
            - **Easily irritated, red, or itchy.** *(Sensitive skin)*  
            - **Rarely reacts, even to strong products.** *(Normal or Oily skin)*  
            - **Reacts sometimes, but not consistently.** *(Combination skin)*  
            **Question 3: Hydration**  
            *"Does your skin often feel dehydrated, regardless of oiliness?"*  
            - **Yes, it feels tight and flaky.** *(Dry or Dehydrated skin)*  
            - **Sometimes, especially in colder months.** *(Combination or Normal skin)*  
            - **Rarely or never.** *(Oily skin)*  
            ---
            **Step 2: Link Products to Choices**
            Associate each answer option with the most appropriate products. For example:  
            - Answers that indicate **Dry Skin** link to products formulated for dry skin.  
            - Answers suggesting **Oily Skin** link to products designed for oily skin.  
            This setup ensures that the quiz [product recommendation algorithm](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/) will automatically provide the most relevant product suggestions.
            *Note: This part is easy. The most difficult part is displaying the right text that corresponds to the product recommendation.*
            ---
            **Step 3: Displaying Skin Type Text Results with Display Logic**
            If you want to display a text summary, like "You have Dry/Oily/Combination/Normal skin," use **Display Logic** to conditionally show content blocks based on customer answers.  
            **Example Setup:**
            1Ô∏è‚É£ **Add Content Blocks to Results Page**  
            Create content blocks on your results page for each skin type. For example:  
            - *You have Dry Skin*  
            - *You have Oily Skin*  
            - *You have Combination Skin*  
            - *You have Normal Skin*  
            ![how to show results explenation personalityquiz1](/images/how_to_show_results_explenation_personalityquiz1.png)
            2Ô∏è‚É£ **Configure Display Logic Rules**  
            Set [Display Logic](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/) rules for when each block should appear, based on the answers.  
            **For Dry Skin:**  
            - If the answer to **Question 1: Oiliness** is *Dry and tight all over*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 2: Sensitivity** is *Easily irritated, red, or itchy*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 3: Hydration** is *Yes, it feels tight and flaky*.  
            Then this block will be **Visible**; otherwise, it remains hidden.  
            ![how to show results explenation personalityquiz2](/images/how_to_show_results_explenation_personalityquiz2.png)
            **For Combination Skin:**  
            Combination skin may result from varied answer paths. You‚Äôll need rules for multiple scenarios:  
            - If the answer to **Question 1: Oiliness** is *Oily in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin), but dry elsewhere*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 2: Sensitivity** is *Reacts sometimes, but not consistently*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 3: Hydration** is *Sometimes, especially in colder months*.  
            **OR**
            - If the answer to **Question 1: Oiliness** is *Very oily, shiny all over*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 2: Sensitivity** is *Easily irritated, red, or itchy*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 3: Hydration** is *Sometimes, especially in colder months*.  
            **OR**
            - If the answer to **Question 1: Oiliness** is *Oily in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin), but dry elsewhere*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 2: Sensitivity** is *Easily irritated, red, or itchy*.  
            - AND the answer to **Question 3: Hydration** is *Sometimes, but not consistently*.         
            Then this block will be **Visible**; otherwise, it remains hidden.  
            ![how to show results explenation personalityquiz3](/images/how_to_show_results_explenation_personalityquiz3.png)
            ![how to show results explenation personalityquiz4](/images/how_to_show_results_explenation_personalityquiz4.png)
            ![how to show results explenation personalityquiz5](/images/how_to_show_results_explenation_personalityquiz5.png)
            3Ô∏è‚É£ **Repeat this process for all other possible combinations of answers.**
            You will have to add similar rules to all the content blocks on the Results Page to show the right text in the end. This means you will have to predict every possible combination of answers a customer can make and add it as Display logic to ensure that the correct text block is shown. 
            ---
            **Simplifying the Process**
            If configuring logic for all combinations feels overwhelming, you can try alternatives highlighted in this article, for example:  
            1. Base your logic on a single question (e.g., Question 1).  
            2. Use JavaScript to dynamically determine the skin type and display the result text.  
            ---
            This step-by-step guide will help you build a personality-type quiz tailored to your customers, making it easier to recommend the perfect products and deliver valuable insights.          
    3. **Custom JavaScript**: For a more refined approach, consider hiring a developer to create a custom JavaScript function. This function can show specific text tailored to the ID of the recommended product. Your developer could also add custom values to quiz choices and create a scoring system for the quiz to then display the right text on the results page. 
        !!! tip
            Instructions on adding custom JavaScript to your Product Recommendation Quiz can be found [here](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/).
    4. **Product Descriptions**: Another option is to enrich your product descriptions with information explaining why each product is recommended. These descriptions are pulled directly from your store's product list. You can manage the visibility of these descriptions in the [Results Page settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) under `Individual Product Settings -> Show description`. Additionally, you have the option to truncate these descriptions for better readability.

# How to Run a Catalog Sync

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

If you're missing products or collections from the list in the [Link Products](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) or [Link Collections/Categories](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/) tab, you can run a product sync from the app's dashboard.
    This article will guide you through troubleshooting and syncing your product catalog with the RevenueHunt app.
    <div class="videoWrapper">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-CHRHuRcAs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
    1. **Navigate to Dashboard:** Log in to your [Dashboard](/reference/dashboard/) and locate the [Success Checklist](/reference/dashboard/#success-checklist).
    2. **Initiate Manual Sync:** Under the `SYNC PRODUCTS FROM YOUR STORE` section, click the `run manual sync` button. The sync takes about 30-60 minutes to complete depending on the size of your catalog.
    !!! info "Important"
        Our app automatically syncs your store's catalog every 24 hours and whenever changes are made in your store's catalog. This includes updates to products, collections, tags, variants, and vendors.
    - If you've **just installed the app**, remember that syncing your store's entire product catalog for the first time can take a bit. Depending on your catalog size, expect to wait anywhere from **30 minutes to several hours** for the sync to complete.
    - Only products marked as **active** will be synced with the app and appear in dropdown choices. **Draft or Archived products are excluded** from the sync and will not be visible.
    - You can manually sync your store **every 1 hour**. Additionally, our app automatically performs a sync every 24 hours to keep your catalog current.
    - For optimal results, make any necessary updates or changes to your store before triggering a manual sync. This ensures your latest product information is accurately reflected in the app.
    - **Check Sync Status:** If your products or collections aren't showing up as expected, or if the product counts remain at zero, it's possible the initial sync is still in progress or has encountered an issue.
    - **Contact Support:** Should issues persist beyond the expected sync time, please [contact our support team](/how-to-guides/contact-customer-support/). We can manually initiate a complete sync of your shop to ensure everything is up-to-date.
    For stores with extensive product catalogs, especially those exceeding 5,000 items, it might not be practical or desirable to include every single product in your quiz recommendations. Fortunately,RevenueHunt app offers a targeted solution: the `collections-first` feature.

# How to Track Quiz Revenue

Understanding the revenue generated from quizzes on your eCommerce store can provide valuable insights into customer engagement and the effectiveness of your marketing strategies. 

This documentation outlines how to track quiz analytics and revenue generated from quizzes in the Revenue Hunt app.

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

The [**Shopify Revenue Report**](#activate-shopify-revenue-report) feature within the RevenueHunt app allows you to track orders tagged by your quiz, offering a clear view of its impact on sales. 
    This how-to article guides you through the process of setting up your Shopify Revenue Report and accessing vital orders data from the quiz.
    Alternatively, you can track quiz revenue with [Google Analytics](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/).
    ## Activate Shopify Revenue Report
    To enable the automated revenue report feature:
    1. **Enable Order Notes**: You need to enable Order Notes in your Theme Settings for this feature to work. Follow [these instructions](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/themes-by-shopify/vintage-themes/customizing-vintage-themes/get-more-information-with-order-notes) to enable them or contact your theme developer.
    2. **Open the Connect tab**: Open the RevenueHunt app and navigate to the [Connect](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab.
    3. **Conect to Shopify Reprots**: Scroll down to find the **Shopify Revenue Report** section. Click on the `Connect` button within the Shopify Revenue Report section.
    4. **Give consent**: The system will ask for your consent to access orders. Once accepted, it will establish a connection between the RevenueHunt app and your Shopify account, allowing the app to start gathering order data tagged by the quiz.
    5. **Publish the changes**: Click on the top-right `Publish` button to updated the quiz preview/live quiz and save the changes.
    After the connection is successfully established, you can access the revenue data generated from your quizzes. Go to the [`Metrics > Analytics`](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#analytics) section within the RevenueHunt app. Here, you will find the following information:
    ![how to track revenue report metrics](/images/how_to_track_revenue_report_metrics.png)
    - **Number of Orders**: Displays the number of people who placed an order after completing the quiz.
    - **Total Orders Value**: Shows the total value of all orders placed following quiz completion.
    - **Avg. Order Value**: Indicates the average value of orders placed post-quiz.
    !!! warning
         Shopify Revenue Tracking and Orders Tagging only works if the customer adds the products to the cart directly from the quiz results page **AND** if they immediately proceed to the cart after the quiz, and then right away complete the purchase. If they purchase at a later date, this revenue will not be attributed to the quiz anymore.

# How to Troubleshoot Product Recommendations in Your Quiz

Navigating through the product recommendations can be challenging, especially when dealing with numerous products and collections/categories linked to quiz choices. 

This guide will walk you through the process of troubleshooting product recommendations. It can help you understand why a certain product was recommended or missing from the Results Page.

!!! warning "Understanding the basics"

    When a particular product appears (or fails to appear) on the Results Page, it's crucial to understand the mechanism behind its selection. This involves tracing back to the quiz responses and analyzing the [voting system](/how-to-guides/set-up-funnel-quiz/#voting-system) or [display logic](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#display-logic-display-section-logic) that influences product visibility.

## Step-by-Step Process to Check Recommendations

!!! tip

    Before you begin, open the [Responses section](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) from the [App manual](/reference/) in the new browser window. It will come in handy.

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/35a595634ca5404d922c725590e96c89?sid=ca0b9ad7-eea5-43b1-9597-6dfa9aee4a2b" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    1. **Access Quiz Metrics**: First, navigate to the quiz [Metrics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/) in the Quiz Builder.
    2. **Explore Responses**: Within Metrics, locate and open the [Responses](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) tab. On the left-hand side menu, you'll find the most recent 100 responses the quiz received organized by date/timestamp. Click on a date to open a specific response.
    3. Check the `Why was a product recommended or not in this response?` section. This section of the app allows you to troubleshoot individual responses and understand why certain products were recommended to the customer or missing from the recommendations.
    4. **Preview the Results Page**: Use the provided link at the bottom of the response details to access the Results Page corresponding to the chosen response. 
        ![how to troubleshoot quiz results preview results](/images/how_to_troubleshoot_quiz_results_preview_results.gif)
    5. On the results page, identify a product of interest‚Äîeither one that appeared unexpectedly on the Results Page or one you anticipated but was missing.
    6. **Conduct a Product Search**: Use the `SELECT PRODUCT TO CHECK` section at the top of the response to search the name of the product in question. Select the product from the search results to further investigate its recommendation status.
        ![how to troubleshoot quiz results search products](/images/how_to_troubleshoot_quiz_results_search_products.gif)
        **Understanding Product Status Colors**
        - **Green**: Indicates products that received votes through the quiz choices.
        - **Red**: Denotes products that were explicitly excluded from recommendations.
        - **White**: Represents products that did not receive any votes, hence their absence from the recommendations.
    7. **Analyze Product Details**: Upon selecting a product, a detailed panel will reveal critical information.
        ![how to troubleshoot quiz results information](/images/how_to_troubleshoot_quiz_results_information.gif)
        Information such as:
        - The collections/categories the product belongs to.
        - The number of votes it received and the reasons for its recommendation or absence.
        - The questions/choices that influenced its votes, including the collections/categories where it was either upvoted or excluded.
        - The specific Results Page and Slots or Product blocks that facilitated its recommendation.
    8. **Troubleshooting and Adjustments**: With this information, you can pinpoint inconsistencies or errors in product categorization, inclusion, or exclusion. 
    !!! tip
        A common issue is a product being **misclassified** into an incorrect collection/category or **accidentally excluded** in quiz settings. Paying close attention to these details can significantly improve the accuracy of your product recommendations.
    Additionally, you may:
    - **Recalculate Recommendations**: If adjustments to the quiz or product collections/categories have been made, use this option to see how these changes affect recommendations.
    - **Resend Notifications**: Useful for updating CRM services or sending revised recommendations via email.

# Troubleshooting Product Recommendation Quiz App Issues for WordPress / WooCommerce

Our Product Recommendation Quiz app is designed to integrate seamlessly with most e-commerce stores. However, due to the high level of customization in WordPress / WooCommerce stores, conflicts with other plugins or store settings can occasionally arise, impacting the app‚Äôs functionality. This guide aims to address common issues and provide clear solutions.

!!! tip "General Troubleshooting Tip"
    
    If you‚Äôve exhausted all listed solutions without success, it may be due to specific configurations in your website. In such cases, consult your developer or hosting provider and review server logs for potential clues. Unfortunately, our capacity to assist is limited in these scenarios.

!!! warning

    Important Addition: Ensure to whitelist our IP address (`3.14.55.225`) in your store‚Äôs settings to facilitate uninterrupted communication between our app and your store.

## Error #1: Request and Data Transmission Issues

!!! example "Error Messages"

    An error occurred in the request and at the time were unable to send the consumer data.

    We tried checking the connection with your WooCommerce API, but was unsuccessful.

    We tried fetching the product varaitions via the WooCommerce API, but was unsuccessful.

    We tried connecting to your WooCommerce API to sync the ‚Äúproducts, but got a status 403.

Possible Causes and Solutions:

1. **Outdated WooCommerce Version**: Ensure your store is running a version later than WooCommerce 3.5.
2. **Outdated Plugin Version**: Ensure you‚Äôve downloaded the latest version of the app.
3. **Lack of HTTPS/SSL Certificate**: Install and activate a valid certificate for secure API communication.
4. **Website Accessibility**: Remove password protection or ‚Äòcoming soon‚Äô plugins that restrict public access.
5. **Caching Plugin Interference**: Disable caching plugins one by one to identify the culprit.
6. **Server Configuration**: If the above don‚Äôt resolve the issue, your server might be stripping the ‚ÄúAuthorization‚Äù header.
7. **Check Security Settings**: Review your store‚Äôs and hosting security settings to ensure they aren‚Äôt conflicting with the app.
8. **Disable Other Plugins**: Temporarily deactivate other plugins and try granting access to our app to see if they are causing a conflict.
9. **Cloudflare Cache**: Exclude the WooCommerce API endpoint (/wp-json/wc/v3/) from Cloudflare‚Äôs cache. Alternatively, use Cloudflare‚Äôs developer mode to bypass the cache temporarily. (Source: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/)

![how to troubleshoot wordpress woocommerce image1](/images/how_to_troubleshoot_wordpress_woocommerce_image1.webp)

Advanced Solutions:

1. Review caching plugin settings related to headers.
2. Generate a new LetsEncrypt certificate.
3. Direct subdomain to bypass Cloudflare CDN Proxy.
4. Switch to a basic WooCommerce Theme like ‚ÄúStorefront‚Äù for initial connection.
5. Add to .htaccess: `SetEnvIf Authorization "(.*)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1`.

**Special Note**: If using CAFE24 hosting, disable the ‚ÄúSPAM Shield‚Äù function.

## Error #2: Authentication and Permission Issues

!!! example "Error Messages"

    It seems that something is interfering with your WordPress Rest API. This needs to be fixed in order to grant access to this plugin.

    Missing parameter app_name

    404 Not Found ‚Äì the requested URL was not found on this server

Possible Causes and Solutions:

1. **WPML or Polylang Plugin Conflict**: Temporarily deactivate WPML/Polylang, authenticate our plugin, then reactivate WPML/Polylang. (As of November 2024, Polylang and Product Recommendation Quiz app cannot be used together.)
2. **Incorrect Callback URL**: Replace `%2F` with `/` in the URL, or remove extra /wp/ from the URL.
3. **Installation Location**: For WooCommerce on a subpage, adjust the URL accordingly (remove /page/). So, instead of `https://yourstore.com/shop/wc-auth/v1/authorize/...` You would use `https://yourstore.com/wc-auth/v1/authorize/...` Even if the first URL is the right path to your WooCommerce store.
4. **Website is not live**: Ensure installation on a live, publicly accessible website. It cannot be hidden by an ‚Äúunder construction‚Äù plugin or setting. The app does not work in local environments.
5. **Check WordPress REST API**: To test it visit  `https://yourstore.com/wp-json/`. If you‚Äôre getting a ‚ÄúNot Found‚Äù or similar error, it‚Äôs possible that you need to fix your WordPress installation. It‚Äôs a problem with the WordPress REST API in your site and not with the WooCommerce REST API. You‚Äôll have to contact your developer to further investigate this issue as it‚Äôs outside of our scope.

!!! example "Error Messages"

    The following REST API endpoint is returning a valid JSON but the returned content-type is text/html instead of the expecred application/json.

Possible Causes and Solutions:

1. **Check JSON format**. This means that even if your site returns a JSON it may not be in the correct format. The WordPress API is returning a response that is encoded as text/html. Normally, it should be application/json.   This is related to your store or server settings, but can also be influenced by another plugin. It is recommended to check it with your developer and fix it.

![how to troubleshoot wordpress woocommerce image2](/images/how_to_troubleshoot_wordpress_woocommerce_image2.jpg)

!!! example "Error Messages"

    Plugin could not be activated because it triggered a fatal error. Fatal error: Cannot redeclare prq_set_token() (previously declared in‚Ä¶)

Possible Causes and Solutions:

1. **Duplicate Plugin Activation**: Deactivate the existing WordPress Plugin (Product recommendation Quiz for eCommerce) before activating the WooCommerce extension (Product Recommendation Quiz for WooCommerce). Don‚Äôt worry, you won‚Äôt lose any data because your quizzes and responses are stored in our server.

![how to troubleshoot wordpress woocommerce image3](/images/how_to_troubleshoot_wordpress_woocommerce_image3.png)

!!! example "Error Messages"

    The plugin does not have a valid header

Possible Causes and Solutions:

1. **Plugins cached**: Your list of Plugins could be cached in whatever WP Object Cache your blog / site is using. (Source: [https://scotty-t.com/2011/03/28/fix-for-the-plugin-does-not-have-a-valid-header/](https://scotty-t.com/2011/03/28/fix-for-the-plugin-does-not-have-a-valid-header/))
2. **Check the Correct Folder Structure**: Ensure that the plugin‚Äôs main file is placed correctly in the wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. **Modify PHP File Headers**: If the headers of PHP files within the plugin resemble the mandatory header of the main plugin file, it can confuse WordPress. Modifying these headers to a different format can resolve the issue. (Source: [https://chattymango.com/how-fix-wordpress-error-plugin-not-valid-header/](https://chattymango.com/how-fix-wordpress-error-plugin-not-valid-header/))
4. **Remove /trunk directory**: Remove `/trunk` directory or activate from the plugin list. (Source: [https://wordpress.org/support/topic/the-plugin-does-not-have-a-valid-header-solution/](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/the-plugin-does-not-have-a-valid-header-solution/))
5. **Outdated Plugin Version**: Ensure you‚Äôve downloaded the latest version of the app.
6. **Two Plugins Installed**: Deactivate and remove the WooCommerce extension before installing the WordPress plugin (or vice versa).

# How to Update Your Shopify Cart Drawer Products After the Quiz

If your quiz is adding products to the cart but your cart drawer isn‚Äôt updating or opening automatically, the issue is likely with how your Shopify theme handles cart updates ‚Äî not with the quiz itself.

This guide explains:

- How RevenueHunt quiz app adds products to the Shopify cart

- Why the cart drawer may not update

- What your theme editor or developer can do to fix it

## Step 1: Understand How Quiz Adds Products to the Cart

Our app uses Shopify‚Äôs official AJAX Cart API to add products. These are the same endpoints used by most Shopify themes and apps.

We use:

- `cart/add.js` ‚Äì adds products to the cart

- `cart/change.js` ‚Äì changes product quantities

- `cart/update.js` ‚Äì updates the cart with new contents

- `cart.js` ‚Äì retrieves the latest state of the cart

These actions notify Shopify that the cart has changed. It‚Äôs then up to the theme to update the UI, such as opening or refreshing the cart drawer.

## Step 2: Confirm If Your Theme Supports Cart Drawer Updates

Most modern themes (like Dawn) include a cart drawer or slide-out cart. However, if your cart drawer does not update after a quiz submission:

- Your theme is likely not listening for changes triggered by AJAX cart actions.

- This can happen even in Shopify‚Äôs default themes if the cart drawer script wasn‚Äôt customized or extended properly.

## Step 3: Talk to Your Theme Developer

Since our app only triggers Shopify‚Äôs standard cart actions, you‚Äôll need to make sure your theme is set up to respond to those actions.

Share the following resources with your developer or Shopify Expert:

- Shopify AJAX Cart Documentation: [https://shopify.dev/docs/api/ajax/reference/cart](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/ajax/reference/cart)

- Helpful guide on listening to AJAX cart events in Shopify themes: [https://www.perplexity.ai/search/how-to-get-shopify-theme-to-li-whWrlpOyT_6ygEG0ZRt68w#0](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/how-to-get-shopify-theme-to-li-whWrlpOyT_6ygEG0ZRt68w#0)


## Step 4: Test Your Setup

Once your theme is updated to listen to the AJAX cart actions, test the following:

1. Complete your quiz and click ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù.

2. Confirm that:

    - Products are added successfully.

    - The cart drawer opens automatically, or

    - The cart UI updates with the new products.


!!! info "Note"

    We do **not** modify your cart drawer or theme layout.

    We **cannot** support theme customization or debug third-party JavaScript.

    We‚Äôre happy to confirm that our app is triggering the correct cart actions ‚Äî [just let us know](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/contact-customer-support/).

    For theme modifications, please consult your theme developer or Shopify Expert.

# How to Use Callback Function for Custom Integrations

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

Custom integrations are essential for developers looking to enhance the functionality of their websites, especially when it comes to tailoring user experiences. One powerful tool for achieving such customization is through the use of JavaScript **callback functions**. 
      This guide will walk you through the process of using a callback function for custom integrations with Product Recommendation Quiz. Whether you're aiming to build your own results page, add unique code, display custom product recommendations, or direct users to specific pages on your store, callback functions offer a versatile solution.
    1. **Initial Setup**: To begin, insert the following code into your store's theme, ideally just before the closing `</head>` tag:
      ```html
      <script>
        function prqQuizCallback(quizResponse){
          console.log(quizResponse);
        }
      </script>
      ```
        This simple example utilizes a `console.log()` function to output the JSON containing all the quiz response data. However, this is merely a starting point. Developers are encouraged to tailor the above callback function to meet their specific needs.
    2. **Store the Data**: Confirm that the callback response is being correctly stored on your website. An effective method involves wrapping the redirection logic within the callback function itself. This ensures the data is mapped or saved before any redirection takes place. For example:
        ```javascript
        function prqQuizCallback(quizResponse) {
        // Code to map or save the data...
        // Then, redirect the user to the desired page:
        window.location.href = 'yourTargetURLHere';
        }
        ```
        Choose an appropriate storage solution for the callback response, such as cookies, local storage, or even as query parameters in the URL, depending on your specific needs and the nature of the data.
    3. **Access the Results Page First**: The callback function is designed to trigger upon reaching the quiz's results page. This sequence ensures that the callback captures the quiz response, saving it as JSON in your website's local storage, before any redirection occurs. It's critical to ensure the results page is accessed even for a fraction of a second to allow this process to unfold correctly.
    4. **Customize the Function**: Beyond merely logging the data, you might want to trigger specific actions based on the quiz outcomes. *For instance, introducing a `prqAddOneToCartCallback(event);` function could be used when a customer adds a product to their cart directly from the quiz results.*
        - There are several other callback functions you can utilize for more granular control and interaction with the quiz results. 
          ```html
          prqSlideCallback(event);
          // triggered when customer responds to a question (slide)
          prqAddOneToCartCallback(event);
          // triggered when customer adds one product to cart 
          prqAddedOneToCartCallback(event);
          // triggered when the product has already been added to the cart 
          prqRemoveOneFromCartCallback(event);
          // triggered when customer removes one product from cart 
          prqRemovedOneFromCartCallback(event);
          // triggered when the product has already been removed from the cart (only Shopify) 
          prqAddAllToCartCallback(event); 
          // triggered when customer adds all products to cart 
          prqAddedAllToCartCallback(event);
          // triggered when all the products have already been added to the cart 
          prqAppLoadedCallback();
          // triggered when the Product Recommendation Quiz app has been loaded 
          ```

# BigCommerce: Use Custom Fields as tags

You can create a Custom Field called ‚Äútags‚Äù within your BigCommerce store and use it to automaticaly group products within the Product Recommendation Quiz. These Custom Fields/tags can be then used to link products in bulk to choices or slots in the quiz.

Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. Navigate to your product page in BigCommerce and add open the `Custom Fields` menu.
    ![Use_Custom_Fields_as_tags_image1.jpg](/images/Use_Custom_Fields_as_tags_image1.jpg)
2. Next, select `+ Add custom fields` to create a new entry.
    ![Use_Custom_Fields_as_tags_image2.jpg](/images/Use_Custom_Fields_as_tags_image2.jpg)
3. In the Custom Field Name type ‚Äútags‚Äù and under Custom Field Value add the tags separated by a coma.
    ![Use_Custom_Fields_as_tags_image3.jpg](/images/Use_Custom_Fields_as_tags_image3.jpg)
4. Make sure to save the changes. You can tag many products in your store this way. 
5. Once you‚Äôre done tagging the products with the custom field called ‚Äútags‚Äù, simply run a [manual sync](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/) of the app to make sure the Product Recommendation Quiz catalog is up to date. Products with the same tags will be automatically grouped together within the app and you‚Äôll be able to link them to choices in the quiz within the [Link Categories/Tags](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/) section.

# How to Add and Use Customer Tags

Effective audience segmentation can dramatically improve the results of your marketing campaigns, and **customer tags** are a powerful tool for achieving this. 

This article will guide you through adding customer tags to choices, using customer tags to segment your audience, and improving your marketing strategies. 

By adding customer tags into your quizzes, you can automatically send quiz results to your mailing list or CRM, enabling precise segmentation based on customer responses.


!!! tip "Why Use Customer Tags?"

    Understanding the value of each member of your audience is crucial. While accumulating a large following on social media or a lengthy email list may seem beneficial, its true value comes into question if you know nothing about the individuals that make up those numbers.

    **The Importance of Segmentation**

    - **FACT 1:** Campaigns that are **highly segmented** can yield more than three times the revenue per recipient compared to unsegmented campaigns.
    - **FACT 2:** Ideally, your business should earn at least $1 per month for each subscriber. If this isn't the case, it indicates that your email list isn't segmented sufficiently.

    Segmentation allows for more personalized marketing strategies. By segmenting your audience based on specific criteria like specific customer tags, you can target them more effectively with tailored content and offers.

    By adding customer tags into your quizzes, you can automatically send quiz results to your mailing list or CRM, enabling precise segmentation based on customer responses.

    1. **Open the Customer Tags tab**: Access the Quiz Builder and navigate to the [`Customer Tags`](/reference/quiz-builder/customer-tags/) section.
    2. **Create new tags**:  To create a tag, start typing the name of the tag next to a choice and confirm with `enter`. Once a tag is created, it can be used to be linked to other choices.
        ![manual_quizbuilder_customertags_addtag](/images/manual_quizbuilder_customertags_addtag.png)
    3. **Link tags to choices**: Create new tags or use the existing ones to link them to choices in the quiz. When a customer selects a choice, all associated tags will be added to their profile.
    4. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Publish` button to publish the changes and update the preview/live quiz.
    1. **Connecting Your Quiz:** Within the [Quiz Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/), find the [`Integrations`](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab. This section allows you to link your quiz with several third-party services, including [Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/), [Hubspot](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-hubspot/), [Omnisend](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-omnisend/), and [Shopify Customers List](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-shopify-customers/). Integration with additional services is possible via [Zapier](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-zapier/) or [Webhooks](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-webhooks/).
    2. **Integration:** After choosing a service to connect, simply follow the provided instructions. This setup ensures that every time someone takes your quiz, their contact details, responses, customer tags and product recommendations are directly sent to your selected mailing list or CRM.
    3. **Using Segmented Data:** In your selected CRM, you can now [create segments based on the customer tags](/how-to-guides/use-customer-tags/#creating-segments-in-your-crm) and [send them targeted emails](#using-segmented-data) based on the quiz results.
    Once integrated, your CRM or mailing list will contain detailed segmented data on your customers. This enables you to create dynamic segments and direct hyper-targeted campaigns to different groups based on their quiz responses. 
    For example, users tagged with `dry_skin` can be targeted with a campaign promoting a specific moisurizing skincare product, while users tagged with `oily_skin` can be targeted with a campaign promoting a specific cleansing product.
    Instructions on how to create segments will vary per CRM platform but in general the segment definition will be similar to the following:
    !!! example "Example of a segment definition"
        If the value of the custom property `tags` contains `dry_skin` then the customer should be included in the segment.
    Any profile that has a tag will be included in the segment automatically.
    !!! warning
        In most integrations, tags are updated with every quiz retake. If you wish to preserve tags from each quiz attempt, [contacting support](/how-to-guides/contact-customer-support/) is recommended for further assistance.
    Once you've set up specific [segement in your CRM based on customer tags](/how-to-guides/use-customer-tags/#creating-segments-in-your-crm), you can use them to send targeted emails to your customers.
    1. Create email flows/campaigns specifically tailored to each segment. When designing tailored email campaigns, it‚Äôs all about crafting messages that really speak to each customer segment‚Äôs unique needs and preferences.
    2. Start by digging into the data from your customer tags to understand what makes each group tick. Create content that addresses their specific interests and personalize your subject lines and email bodies to make them feel valued. Plan your campaign schedule carefully to keep people engaged without overwhelming them, and use automation to send timely, relevant emails based on their behavior.
        !!! example
            - Curly Hair Segment: Send emails featuring products designed for curly hair, such as curl-enhancing shampoos and conditioners, and styling creams. Include tips for maintaining curly hair and exclusive offers on curl care bundles.
            - Dry Hair Segment: Send emails promoting moisturizing shampoos, conditioners, and deep-conditioning treatments. Share tips on how to combat dry hair and offer discounts on hydrating product sets.
    3. Use automation to send timely, relevant emails based on their behavior.

# How to use Display Logic

[Display logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#display-logic) is a feature of the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) that allows you to make elements visible or hidden on the results page based on conditional logic rules.

!!! info "Use Display Logic to:"

    - Show or hide content on the results page based on customer's responses to questions.
    - Show or hide content on the results page based on the score of a variable (custom scoring quiz, personality-type quiz).
    - Show or hide content on the results page based on the variable with the highest score (personality-type quiz).

In this article, we provide a clear, step-by-step guide on how to use Display Logic, its workings, and examples to illustrate its functionality.

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

<div class="videoWrapper"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVAg0KfkX5Q?si=-3_Sv297f8B4-KPi" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
    ??? question "What content be added to the Results Page?"
        You can add different types of building blocks to your results page:
        - **Heading Block** - Adds a new heading to your page, ideal for titles or section breaks.
        - **Content Block** - Adds a new content block to your page, ideal for adding and formatting text, lists, and links.
        - **HTML Block** - Adds a block where you can input custom HTML code for advanced content and styling.
        - **Image Block** - Adds an embedded image block into your page. You can upload your own image. The image should be max 1000px x 1000px and max 2MB.
        - **Products Block** - Adds a block specifically designed for displaying a list of recommended products.
        - **Slots Block** - Adds a block specifically designed for displaying the recommended products sorted into slots. Slots allow you to group recommended products into different categories (e.g. cleanser, toner, serum, moisturizer...). Slots show the most voted products from a collection that's linked to the slot.
    With Display Logic you can make blocks visible or hidden based on customer's responses.
    1. **Find a block**: Start by identifying or adding the block you wish to add Display Logic to. 
    2. **Open Display Logic settings**: Look for a `conditional logic / tree icon` button and click it. 
        ![quiz builder results page block menu](/images/manual_quizbuilder_resultspage_blockmenu.png)
        **conditional logic** / **tree icon** - Opens the [Display Logic](#display-logic) menu.
    3. Next, select `add Display Logic`.
        ![quiz builder results page display logic](/images/manual_quizbuilder_resultspage_blockmenu_displaylogic.png)
    3. **Add your rules**: Add you display logic rules for when the block should be visible or hidden. 
        !!! info
            All the Display Logic rules follow the same format
            - **IF response to** pick the question from a dropdown list
            - **is**/ **is not** pick a choice from the dropdown list
            - **THEN block is** pick either **Visible** or **Hidden**
            - **IN ALL OTHER CASES this block is** pick pick either **Visible** or **Hidden**
        !!! example
            ![quiz builder results page display logic example](/images/manual_quizbuilder_resultspage_blockmenu_displaylogic_example.png)
            In the example, if a user chooses a choice "A gift" in Question 1 "Who are you shopping for?" then this content block with text "This is content text." will be visible. If they give a different answer in Question 1 this content block will be hidden.
    4. You can add multiple rules by clicking the `+` button.
        - **+** - Adds another Display Logic rule. Adds a new OR logical rule.
        - **bin** - Delete the current Display Logic rule.
        - **+ add concurrent logic** - Adds a new AND logical statement to the same rule. AND conditional statements can be tricky, as both statements have to be true for the rule to take effect. For most quizzes, using the OR rule is enough.
    4. **Preview and Adjust**: Publish the changes with the top-right Publish button to update the preview/live quiz and test the setup.
    Scoring system is not available in the legacy version of the Shopify app. Your developer can implement a custom scoring system with JavaScript on the Results Page instead. Check this article to learn how to add custom JavaScript to the Results Page: [How to Add Custom JavaScript to the Results Page](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/).
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVAg0KfkX5Q?si=tBJo7gXHs4dvRTn1" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    **Scenario**
    You want to show a custom text block based on the customer's answer to a question. Imagine creating a quiz that determines a personalized skincare routine. *Question 4* might ask about the participant's skin type, and depending on the answer, a different text and recommendation about their skincare is shown on the Results Page. This individualized response is made possible by Display Logic.
    **Implementation**
    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add a `Multiple choice question` asking the customer about their skin type: Dry, Normal, Oily, or Combination-type skin. 
        !!! tip
            Use the description box in `Question Settings -> Show Description` to help customers determine their skin type.
    2. **Add Content Blocks to Results Page**: Go to the Results Page and add a new `content block`. To add a content block click the `+` sign and select `Content Block` from the list. Add multiple content blocks describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:
        !!! example
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness ‚Äì we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that‚Äôs deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn‚Äôt experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin‚Äôs natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
        !!! tip    
            Make the heading stand out with [markdown language](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/). Use the`#` sign before a sentence can make it bold.
    3. **Add Display Logic**: If we don‚Äôt add [Display Logic](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/) to the quiz, our blocks will just appear one after the other on the Results Page, regardless of the choice we made. To add Display Logic, select a content block and click on `display logic`. Next, click `add display logic`. Set up IF-THEN statements to control when each content block should be visible or hidden based on the customer's choices.
        ![how to hide content with logic display logic statement](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_display_logic_statement.png)
    4. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.
    **Scenario**
    You're building a personality-type or Dosha quiz. You want to show a different text and product recommendations based on the winning variable. For examples, if the user chooses mostly A's, B's, C's, etc. a different section with different text and product recommendations is shown.
    **Implementation**
    Custom Scores or variables are not natively supported in the legacy version of the RevenueHunt app. In this version of the app displaying content based on a custom score or variable is only possible via custom JavaScript and may require help from a developer.
    Check our [How to Add JavaScript](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) guide for more information on implementing custom JavaScript into your product recommendation quiz.
    **Scenario**
    You're building a custom scoring or presonality-type quiz. You want to show a different text and product recommendations based on the score of a variable. For examples, if the user's score is above 50, a different section with different text and product recommendations is shown.
    **Implementation**
    Custom Scores or variables are not natively supported in the legacy version of the RevenueHunt app. In this version of the app displaying content based on a custom score or variable is only possible via custom JavaScript and may require help from a developer.
    Check our [How to Add JavaScript](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) guide for more information on implementing custom JavaScript into your product recommendation quiz.

# How to Use Information Recalls / Content Dynamic Source

Information recalls / Content Dynamic Source allow you to reuse participants' previously entered responses, such as their name or quiz answers, in subsequent questions, results pages, or follow-up communications. This personalizes the quiz experience by making it more relevant and engaging for the participant.

![how to use information recalls example filled](/images/how_to_use_information_recalls_example_filled.png)

## Adding Information Recalls / Content Dynamic Source

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/71f4dd83be8747719557e5571a48edfb?sid=97b689d3-4e21-4794-aedd-8d0c623072b2" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    1. **Initiate Recall Feature**: While crafting your quiz questions or setting up follow-up communications, press the `@` symbol on your keyboard. This action activates the recall feature. 
        - If nothing happens after you click the `@` symbol, you can also initiate this function from [Question Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).
        - Information Recalls cannot be added to the first question in the quiz.
    2. **Select From Available Data**: Upon triggering the recall feature, a dropdown menu will appear, listing all available questions and data points collected from participants up to that point in the quiz. Scroll through the dropdown menu to find the specific piece of information you wish to recall. Whether it's the participant's name, their answers to previous questions, or other collected data, simply click on your choice to select it.
        ![how to use information recalls clicked](/images/how_to_use_information_recalls_clicked.png)
    3. **Implement Recalls**: Once selected, the chosen data will be integrated into your current question, email subject line, or message body. Instead of seeing a generic placeholder, participants will see the recalled information, such as their name, making the interaction feel uniquely tailored to them.
        ![how to use information recalls example](/images/how_to_use_information_recalls_example.png)
    Information recall / Content Dynamic Source can be used in various parts of your quiz to enhance personalization:
    - **Follow-up Questions:** Make your quiz feel more conversational by recalling the participant's name or other responses in later questions.
    - **Results Page:** Display personalized messages or recommendations on the results page by recalling the participant's name and answers.
    - **Email Communications:** Beyond the quiz itself, recall information in your [follow-up emails](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/) to provide a cohesive and personalized experience from start to finish. Personalize follow-up emails by including the participant's name in the subject line or email body. Use the "@" symbol to access and insert the participant's name and other relevant information into your email content.

    - Branch the quiz based on the user's answers.
    - Send users to different results pages based on their answers.
    - Send users to an external URL based on their answers.

In this article, we provide a clear, step-by-step guide on how to use Jump Logic, its workings, and examples to illustrate its functionality.

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

<div class="videoWrapper"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HfYhbWB21Qg?si=K5rbKH2WhSmVBTeP" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
    ![quiz builder conditional logic](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic.png)
    In the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab you can branch your quiz. The left menu allows you to add conditional logic rules to questions in the quiz. The right menu shows a logic tree of the quiz. Any branching you add will be reflected on the tree preview.
    By default, the quiz will progress from one question to another based on the question number. Conditional logic allows you to change this default behavior.
    ??? question "How to navigate the Conditional Logic tab?"
        ![quiz builder conditional logic preview options](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_previewoptions.png)
        **+** - Zoom in on the logic tree preview.
        **-** - Zoom out on the logic tree preview.
        **[]** - Center the logic tree preview and fit into view.
        Drag the logic tree with your mouse left button to navigate to specific branches.
        ![quiz builder quiz design switch question](/images/manual_quizbuilder_quizdesign_switchquestion.png)
        The top menu allows you to switch between questions.
        **arrow up** - Takes you to the question higher.
        **arrow down** - Take you to the question lower.
    1. Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/).
    2. **Open Jump Logic**: Navigate to the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab and select [`Jump Logic`](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) section.
    3.  **Add Jump Logic**: Click `Add Jump Logic` to add a new Jump Logic rule for the selected question. Here, you'll define your conditional statement using the template:
        - IF the response to `question X`
        - IS EQUAL TO `choice Y`
        - THEN go to `question Z`
        !!! example
            ![quiz builder conditional logic jump logic rule](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogicrule.png){width="500"}
            In the example, if a user chooses a choice "Myself" in Question 1 "Who are you shopping for?" then they will be redirected to Question 2 "What is your skin type?".
    4. **Multiple Conditions:** You can add more than one Jump Logic rule to a single question by clicking on the big `+` button in the bottom right corner. This allows for complex paths that can direct participants to various follow-up questions based on their specific answers.
        - **+** - Add another Jump Logic rule. Adds a new OR logical rule.
            !!! example
                ![quiz builder conditional logic jump logic OR rule](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogicrule_or.png)
                In the example, if a user chooses a choice "Myself" in Question 1 "Who are you shopping for?" then they will be redirected to Question 2 "What is your skin type?" but if the user chooses a choice "A gift" in Question 1 "Who are you shopping for?" then they will be redirected to Question 4 "What is their skin type?".
        - **bin** - Delete the current Jump Logic rule.
        - **+ add concurrent logic** - Adds a new AND logical statement to the same rule. AND conditional statements can be tricky, as both statements have to be true for the rule to take effect. For most quizzes, using the OR rule is enough.
            !!! example
                ![quiz builder conditional logic jump logic AND rule](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogicrule_and.png){width="500"}
                In the example, **only if** a user chooses a choice "Myself" in Question 1 "Who are you shopping for?" **and** a choice "Dry" in Question 2 "What is your skin type?" they will be redirected to Question 3 "What's your age?".
        - **Always jump to:** - Select a slide or URL where the user will be always redirected after this slide.
    5. **Preview and Adjust:** Publish the changes with the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz and test the setup.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HfYhbWB21Qg?si=K5rbKH2WhSmVBTeP" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    ![how to hide content with logic jump logic](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_jump_logic.png){width="500"}
    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add a `Multiple choice question` asking the customer about their skin type: Dry, Normal, Oily, or Combination-type skin. 
        !!! tip
            Use the description box in `Question Settings -> Show Description` to help customers determine their skin type.
    2. **Create Statement Questions**: Add multiple `Statement` slides describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:
        !!! example
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness ‚Äì we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that‚Äôs deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn‚Äôt experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin‚Äôs natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
    3. **Add Jump Logic**: If we don‚Äôt add jump logic to the quiz, our statement questions will just appear one after the other, regardless of the choice we made. To add jump logic, you should go back to the skin type question and select [conditional logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/). Set up `IF-THEN` statements with `OR` logic to direct the customer to the correct text based on their skin type. 
        ![how to hide content with logic jump logic statement](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_jump_logic_statement.png)
    4. **Add "Always Jump to..." Logic**: Once all the statements are linked with logic to the skin type question, you should point each statement to the next question in the quiz. This is done by going to the [jump logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/) tab and scrolling toward the `Always jump to...` section. Point each statement to the next question.
    4. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.

# How to Use Markdown Language

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

Markdown is an incredibly versatile language that allows you to format text on the web. It's used widely for creating readable and convertible text to HTML, enabling the styling of documents through simple syntax. 
    This guide will walk you through the basics of Markdown Language, using the syntax supported by RevenueHunt‚Äôs Product Recommendation Quiz, to help you incorporate various styling elements into your content efficiently.
    ??? question "What is Markdown Language?"
        Markdown allows you to format words as bold or italic, add images, create lists, and much more, using just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters, such as `#` or `*`. It's designed to be as straightforward as possible, making it accessible for anyone to learn and use.
    RevenueHunt app uses its own version of Markdown syntax, supporting a curated set of elements to enhance your questions, choices, and results pages.
    ![how to use markdown languge example](/images/how_to_use_markdown_languge_example.png)
    Headings are essential for structuring your content, making it easier to read and navigate. In Markdown, you create headings by prefixing your text with one or more hash (`#`) symbols. The number of hashes before your text determines the level of the heading:
    ```markdown
    # H1
    ## H2
    ### H3
    ```
    To emphasize text, you can make it italic or bold. Markdown uses asterisks (*) or underscores (_) to create italic or bold text. Here's how you can style your text:
    ```markdown
    *italic text*
    **bold text**
    ***italic & bold text***
    ```
    Adding links to your content can provide readers with additional resources. To insert a link in Markdown, you use square brackets to enclose the anchor text and parentheses to enclose the URL:
    ```markdown
    [link title](https://www.example.com)
    ```
    Images can enhance your content visually, making it more engaging. To add an image, you use an exclamation mark followed by square brackets for the alt text and parentheses for the image URL:
    ```markdown
    ![alt text](https://www.example.com/path/to/image.jpg)
    ```
    Including videos can make your content even more interactive and informative. Videos hosted on YouTube or Vimeo can be embedded using the standard Markdown image syntax, with the video URL in the parentheses:
    ```markdown
    ![](https://youtu.be/0_tO8HgJiLQ)
    ![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_tO8HgJiLQ)
    ![](https://vimeo.com/142172484)
    ![](https://player.vimeo.com/video/142172484)
    ```
    Videos are displayed responsively at 100% of their container‚Äôs width, with the height automatically determined based on a 16:9 aspect ratio. You can customize the aspect ratio or specify a fixed width and height using additional attributes in the Markdown:
    ```markdown
    ![](https://youtu.be/zNzZ1PfUDNk){ratio="16:9"}
    ![](https://youtu.be/0_tO8HgJiLQ){width="560" height="315"}

# How to Use Skip Logic

[Skip Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#skip-logic) is a tool used in quizzes or surveys to make answering questions smoother for people taking them. It works by changing the order of questions based on the answers given to previous questions. This means if someone answers a question a certain way, they might skip some questions or see different ones next. 

!!! info "Use Skip Logic to:"

    - Skip questions based on the user's answers.
    - Show different follow-up questions based on the user's answers to multiple-choice questions that allow multiple selections. For example, if you want to show different follow-up questions based on the (skin, health) concerns the user selects.


In this article, we will show you how to set up and use Skip Logic in your quiz, including specific use-cases and step-by-step instructions.

    ![quiz builder conditional logic](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic.png)
    In the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab you can branch your quiz. The left menu allows you to add conditional logic rules to questions in the quiz. The right menu shows a logic tree of the quiz. Any branching you add will be reflected on the tree preview.
    By default, the quiz will progress from one question to another based on the question number. Conditional logic allows you to change this default behavior.
    ??? question "How to navigate the Conditional Logic tab?"
        ![quiz builder conditional logic preview options](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_previewoptions.png)
        **+** - Zoom in on the logic tree preview.
        **-** - Zoom out on the logic tree preview.
        **[]** - Center the logic tree preview and fit into view.
        Drag the logic tree with your mouse left button to navigate to specific branches.
        ![quiz builder quiz design switch question](/images/manual_quizbuilder_quizdesign_switchquestion.png)
        The top menu allows you to switch between questions.
        **arrow up** - Takes you to the question higher.
        **arrow down** - Take you to the question lower.
    1. You can introduce Skip Logic into your quiz by accessing the [Conditional Logic settings](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) of a question.
    2. Open the [Skip Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#skip-logic) tab. 
    3. **Add Skip Logic**: From here, click `Add Skip Logic`. You can create a new Skip Logic statement specifying the conditions under which the current question should be bypassed. These statements follow a simple format: IF the answer to `question X` IS EQUAL TO `choice Y`, THEN skip this question. 
        !!! example
            ![quiz builder conditional logic skip logic rule](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_skiplogicrule.png)
            In the example, if a user chooses a choice "A gift" in Question 1 "Who are you shopping for?" then Question 2 "What is your skin type?" will be skipped (it will not be shown).
    4. All slides that contain Skip Logic will be marked with `"skip logic"` text.
    5. Multiple Skip Logic rules can be added to any question if needed.
        - **+** - Adds another Skip Logic rule. Adds a new OR logical rule.
        - **bin** - Delete the current Skip Logic rule.
        - **+ add concurrent logic** - Adds a new AND logical statement to the same rule. AND conditional statements can be tricky, as both statements have to be true for the rule to take effect. For most quizzes, using the OR rule is enough.
    5. **Preview and Adjust:** Publish the changes with the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz and test the setup.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHYDwwTIuWg?si=pRhc-juq4lgIsIw2" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    **Scenario**
    You want to provide personalized advice based on the customer's skin type. Imagine creating a quiz that determines a personalized skincare routine. *Question 4* might ask about the participant's skin type, and depending on the answer, a different statement or recommendation about their skincare is shown. This individualized response is made possible by Skip Logic, which then continues the quiz based on the participant's specific path.
    ![how to use skip logic example](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_skip_logic.png)
    **Implementation**
    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add a `Multiple choice question` asking the customer about their skin type: Dry, Normal, Oily, or Combination-type skin. 
        !!! tip
            Use the description box in `Question Settings -> Show Description` to help customers determine their skin type.
    2. **Create Statement Questions**: Add multiple `Statement` slides describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:
        !!! example
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness ‚Äì we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that‚Äôs deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn‚Äôt experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin‚Äôs natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
    3. **Add Skip Logic**: If we don‚Äôt add skip logic to the quiz, our statement questions will just appear one after the other, regardless of the choice we made. To add [skip logic](/how-to-guides/use-skip-logic/), you should go back to the skin type question and select `conditional logic`. Next, you should navigate to the `Skip Logic` section and add a skip logic rule to each statement. Use skip logic to ensure that only relevant statement questions appear based on the customer's skin type selection.
        ![how to hide content with logic skip logic statement](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_skip_logic_statement.png)
    4. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.
    **Scenario**
    You want to create a beauty quiz where customers can select multiple areas of concern (nails, skin, hair, etc.) and then only see follow-up questions relevant to their selections.
    **Implementation**
    1. **Create a Multiple Selection Question**: Start with a question that allows customers to select multiple options, such as "Which areas would you like to focus on?" with choices like "Nails", "Skin", "Hair", and "Makeup".
        !!! tip
            You can allow multiple selections in the [block settings > multiple choice settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#multiple-choice).
    2. **Set Up Follow-up Questions**: Create a series of follow-up questions for each area, arranged in groups:
        - Questions 2-3: Nail-related questions
        - Questions 4-5: Skin-related questions
        - Questions 6-7: Hair-related questions
        - Questions 8-9: Makeup-related questions
    3. **Apply Skip Logic to Each Follow-up Question**:
        - For each nail-related question (2-3), add a Skip Logic rule: "IF response to Question 1 IS NOT 'Nails' THEN this question is skipped"
        - For each skin-related question (4-5), add a Skip Logic rule: "IF response to Question 1 IS NOT 'Skin' THEN this question is skipped"
        - For each hair-related question (6-7), add a Skip Logic rule: "IF response to Question 1 IS NOT 'Hair' THEN this question is skipped"
        - For each makeup-related question (8-9), add a Skip Logic rule: "IF response to Question 1 IS NOT 'Makeup' THEN this question is skipped"
        !!! example
            ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_skiplogic_example](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_skiplogic_example.png)
            In the example, if a user chooses a choice "Too shiny" in Question 9 "SKIN CONCERNS" then Question 10 "ALERGIES" will be skipped (it will not be shown).
    4. **Result**: When a customer selects multiple areas (e.g., "Nails" and "Skin"), they will only see the follow-up questions for those specific areas, skipping all others. This creates a personalized experience while maintaining a linear quiz structure.
    !!! tip
        This approach works best with a linear quiz structure (no branching). The key is to use the "IS NOT" condition in your Skip Logic rules, which ensures that questions are only shown when the customer has selected the relevant option in the main question.
    **Scenario**
    You want to collect emails from interested customers without deterring others.
    ![how to use skip logic example2](/images/how_to_use_skip_logic_example2.png)
    **Implementation**
    - Start with a `Yes/No question` asking if the customer is willing to leave their email.
    - Follow up with an `email` input question.
    - Apply Skip Logic to the email question: if the customer opts out in the previous step, they are directed straight to the results page, bypassing the email question.

    `Your best email` -  Provide your best email (not your store email) for communication in case of issues.
    `Send notifications to email` - Toggle the button to activate the notification emails to your best email. Once active we will send the notifications that appear on the dashboard to your best email. For example, in case you go over your plan's limits, CSV export completions or connection issues.

    ![app settings catalogue](/images/manual_appsettings_catalogue.png)
    `Metafields Namespaces` - We will import the metafields information for the following namespaces. You will then be able to display this information on the product's result page. In this section, we'll display a list of metafield categories found in your store. You can toggle the button to activate the metafields.

    When you connect the RevenueHunt app to your SMTP Server, the follow-up emails with the quiz results that are sent to your customers won't be sent from our *no-reply@prq.email* email account, they'll be sent from your email account. 
    !!! tip

![quiz builder conditional logic](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic.png)
    In the Conditional Logic tab you can branch your quiz or tell it to skip certain questions. The left menu allows you to add conditional logic rules to questions in the quiz. The right menu shows a logic tree of the quiz. Any branching you add will be reflected on the tree preview.
    By default, the quiz will progress from one question to another based on the question number. Conditional logic allows you to change this default behavior.
    ![quiz builder conditional logic preview options](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_previewoptions.png)
    `+` - Zoom in on the logic tree preview.
    `-` - Zoom out on the logic tree preview.

    The top menu allows you to switch between questions.

    `arrow down` - Take you to the question lower.
    Jump Logic allows you to route customers to different questions based on their responses.
    `Add Jump Logic` - Click to add a new Jump Logic rule for the selected question.
    !!! info
        All the Jump Logic rules follow the same format
        - **IF response to** pick the question from a dropdown list
        - **is**/ **is not** pick a choice from the dropdown list
        - **THEN go to:** pick a slide from the dropdown list or add a URL 
    !!! example
        ![quiz builder conditional logic jump logic rule](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogicrule.png){width="500"}
        ![quiz builder conditional logic jump logic rule go to](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogicrule_goto.png){width="500"}
        In the example, if a user chooses a choice "Myself" in Question 1 "Who are you shopping for?" then they will be redirected to Question 2 "What is your skin type?".
    `+` - Add another Jump Logic rule. Adds a new OR logical rule.
    !!! example
        ![quiz builder conditional logic jump logic OR rule](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogicrule_or.png)

    `bin` - Delete the current Jump Logic rule.
    `+ add concurrent logic` - Adds a new AND logical statement to the same rule. AND conditional statements can be tricky, as both statements have to be true for the rule to take effect. For most quizzes, using the OR rule is enough.

        In the example, **only if** a user chooses a choice "Myself" in Question 1 "Who are you shopping for?" **and** a choice "Dry" in Question 2 "What is your skin type?" they will be redirected to Question 3 "What's your age?".
    `Always jump to:` - Select a slide or URL where the user will be always redirected after this slide.
    Skip Logic determines whether a question is presented or skipped based on responses to previous questions. By default, if no Skip Logic is added to a question, it will be shown.
    `Add Skip Logic` - Click to add a new Skip Logic rule for the selected question.
    !!! info
        All the Skip Logic rules follow the same format

        In the example, if a user chooses a choice "A gift" in Question 1 "Who are you shopping for?" then Question 2 "What is your skin type?" will be skipped (it will not be shown).
    All slides that contain Skip Logic will be marked with `"skip logic"` text.

    ??? question "Show custom shorter product description"
        It's possible to shorten the product descriptions that appear in the recommendations page. The following instructions include screenshots from a Shopify store, but it's also possible for WooCommerce stores (detailed instructions [here](https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/blocks/more-block/)) and BigCommerce stores.
        This feature allows you to add a code snippet in your product description where you want to cut it. In your eCommerce backend, navigate to the product you want to edit. To can add the `<!--more-->` code snippet in your product¬†description, just click on the `Show HTML` button:
        ![manual quiz builder shorter product description image1](/images/manual_quiz_builder_shorter_product_description_image1.png)
        And paste the `<!--more-->` code after the introductory blurb:
        ![manual quiz builder shorter product description image2](/images/manual_quiz_builder_shorter_product_description_image2.png)
        This should cut the¬†description on the quiz results page:
        ![manual quiz builder shorter product description image3](/images/manual_quiz_builder_shorter_product_description_image3.png)
        You'll have to **deactivate** the `truncate¬†description` in the Results Page settings in our app so the¬†description¬†is shown full and cut at the code snippet. Remember that you'll have to do this for **all the products** that will be recommended in the quiz.

        ??? question "Show custom shorter product description"
            It's possible to shorten the product descriptions that appear in the recommendations page. The following instructions include screenshots from a Shopify store, but it's also possible for WooCommerce stores (detailed instructions [here](https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/blocks/more-block/)) and BigCommerce stores.
            This feature allows you to add a code snippet in your product description where you want to cut it. In your eCommerce backend, navigate to the product you want to edit. To can add the `<!--more-->` code snippet in your product description, just click on the `Show HTML` button:
            ![manual quiz builder shorter product description image1](/images/manual_quiz_builder_shorter_product_description_image1.png)
            And paste the `<!--more-->` code after the introductory blurb:
            ![manual quiz builder shorter product description image2](/images/manual_quiz_builder_shorter_product_description_image2.png)
            This should cut the description on the quiz results page:
            ![manual quiz builder shorter product description image3](/images/manual_quiz_builder_shorter_product_description_image3.png)
            You'll have to **deactivate** the `truncate description` in the Results Page settings in our app so the description is shown full and cut at the code snippet. Remember that you'll have to do this for **all the products** that will be recommended in the quiz.

    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xtMj6vYux9c?si=BiZzrohxwi78qzNE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
    In this tutorial, you‚Äôll learn how to use simple [conditional logic](/how-to-guides/use-conditional-logic/) to give personalized advice. 
    A quiz can act as a professional shopping assistant. It can react to the answers given by the customer and provide valuable feedback. All it takes is a bit of logic. 
    In this Skin Care Quiz, there are four blocks of text. Each describes in more detail what a skin type needs in terms of skincare.
    With RevenueHunt app, you can show customers with dry skin certain questions (specifically targeted for them), while customers with oily skin would skip these questions. This can be done in many ways within the app.
    **Objective**: In this video, we‚Äôll teach you how to show these texts using [Jump Logic](#jump-logic), [Skip Logic](#skip-logic), or [Display Logic](#display-logic) on the results page.
    Let‚Äôs start with Jump Logic.
    1. To display text advice in the quiz, you‚Äôll need a `Statement question`.
    2. Make it longer by adding a description.
    3. One statement will be needed for each type of skin advice.
    Now, how can we make only one block appear, instead of all of them, one after the other? We can use [Jump Logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/).
    1. Open the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab and select a question. 
    2. Let‚Äôs add the first [Jump logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) condition:
        - If the answer to `‚ÄòHow does your skin feel on an average day?‚Äô` is `‚ÄòDry and tight all over‚Äô` then *Dry skin* advice should appear. 
    3. Click on the `+` plus sign to add another statement that can be true. This creates an additional `OR` conditional statement.
        - If the answer to `‚ÄòHow does your skin feel on an average day?‚Äô` is `‚ÄòOily all over‚Äô` then *Oily skin* advice should appear. 
    4. The `OR` separator between conditions means that only one of these has to be true for the logic to work.
    5. Let‚Äôs add conditions for the *Combination* and *Normal* skin.
    6. To ensure the customer doesn‚Äôt see all four statements additional [Jump logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) should be added to each of them. 
    7. Click on a `statement` question.
    8. In the `Always jump to‚Ä¶` section, indicate the question or a page that should preceed it.
    9. Do the same for the other three statements.
    10. Now that all is set, let‚Äôs update the preview/live quiz with the top-right `Publish` button and test it with `Preview`.
        - First, select `Dry skin`. 
        - Now let‚Äôs go back and select `Oily skin`.
    It seems that everything works correctly, well done!
    You‚Äôve successfully added Jump Logic to your quiz. Your customers will now be able to see this personalized advice whenever they take the quiz.
    !!! tip "Jump Logic - other use cases"
        [Jump Logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/) is a powerful tool. It can also be used to:
        - redirect the customer to another, external URL directly from the quiz,
        - create branching in the quiz to send the customer to different answering paths,
        - create branching to link different products to the same choices,
        - or send customers to different Result Pages.
    For linear quizzes, using [Skip Logic](/how-to-guides/use-skip-logic/) instead is recommended.
    To achieve the same effect you can set up your statements to be shown one after another.
    1. Navigate to the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab, select a question and open the [Skip Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#skip-logic) menu.
    2. Then, add a Skip Logic rule to each statement. For example, when selecting a *Dry skin* statement, the rule states:
        - If the answer question `‚ÄòHow does your skin feel on an average day?‚Äô` **IS NOT**  `Dry and tight all over`, then this question is skipped.
        - This implies that the *Dry skin* statement will **NOT** be skipped only if the answer to that question is `Dry and thigh all over`. In all other cases, the statement will **NOT** be shown.
    3. Similar rules shall be applied to the statements about the *Oily*, *Combination*, and *Normal* skin.
    4. Once all is set up, make sure to publish the changes with the top-right `Publish` button.
    5. Let‚Äôs test the quiz with the `Preview` button.
    It worked! The correct statement is shown and all the others are skipped based on the skin type the customer selected in the previous question.
    !!! tip "Skip Logic - other use cases"
        [Skip logic](/how-to-guides/use-skip-logic/) can also be used to:
        - show or hide a number of follow-up questions,
        - show or hide follow-up content based on questions that allow multiple answers.
    Logic can also be applied to the contents of your [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/). 
    With [Display logic](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/), you can show or hide elements of your results page based on the customer's answers.
    1. Let‚Äôs add four `Content blocks` with the skin type advice to your [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/).
    2. You can edit the block text with [Markdown language](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/).
    3. Now, how can we make only one block appear, instead of all of them? We can add [Display logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#display-logic).
    4. To do that, activate it in the lower right corner with the `...` button. 
    5. Let‚Äôs add the first logic condition.
        - If the answer to `‚ÄòHow does your skin feel on an average day?‚Äô` is `‚ÄòDry and tight all over‚Äô` then this block (*Dry skin block*) will be **Visible**. 
        - In all other cases, it will be **Hidden**. 
    6. Now, let‚Äôs add similar rules to other content blocks.
    7. Let‚Äôs publish the changes with the top-right `Publish` button and test the quiz again with `Preview`.
    You‚Äôve now successfully used Display logic to show and hide content on the Results page.
    !!! tip "Display Logic - other use cases"
        [Display Logic](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/) is a powerful tool that can also be used to:
        - show different image results depending on customer answers
        - or show product blocks with different numbers of recommendations.

    Sending a follow-up email with Klaviyo is very easy. Let's get started.
    To send contacts to Klaviyo your quiz needs to have an `email question`. 
    1. You can add it to the quiz from the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) tab.
    2. You can [ask for marketing consent](/how-to-guides/ask-for-marketing-consent/) directly in the quiz. 
        !!! example "Example"
            - You can inform the customer in the [question description](/how-to-guides/ask-for-marketing-consent#option-1-question-description) that by providing the email address they agree to receive marketing information.
            - Or you can add a [marketing checkmark](/how-to-guides/ask-for-marketing-consent#option-2-marketing-checkmark) by joining two slides together. 
    To connect the quiz to Klaviyo you'll have to provide your Klaviyo **Public API Key**. 
    Public API Key is essential because it allows us to send information to Klaviyo Profiles.
    1. To find your Public Key login to your Klaviyo account.
    2. In account `Settings` open the `API Keys` tab and copy the public API Key.
    3. Navigate back to the RevenueHunt app. 
    4. In the [`Quiz > Connect`](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab, scroll to Klaviyo and `edit` the connection.
    5. Paste your Public API Key and `save`.
    6. Publish the changes with the top-right `Publish` button.
    7. Test quiz all the way to the results. Make sure to provide a sample email that doesn't already exist in your Kalviyo account.
    8. To verify the test, open `Kalviyo > Profiles` section.
    9. If a new profile was added the integration was successful.
        !!! tip
            If a new profile wasn't added to Profiles in Klaviyo, double-check your Public API Key and repeat the process.
    From now on all the contacts coming from the quiz will be added to your Klaviyo account.
    All quiz contacts can be grouped into a **segment** in Klaviyo. 
    1. To create a new segment in Klaviyo go to  `Audience > List & Segements` and click `Create New > New Segment`.
    2. Name the segment and set up the definition.
    3. The `Permalink-QuizID`  property is unique for profiles coming from the quiz.
    4. If you don't see the permalink property in the dropdown menu, you may need to take a test quiz and try again.
    5. Click `Create a segment`.

    If you've [asked for marketing consent in the quiz](/how-to-guides/ask-for-marketing-consent/), you can update it in the Klaviyo email flow. Just follw these steps:
    1. Right below the flow trigger, add a `Profile property update` action.
    2. Click `+ Step`.
    3. A menu will appear letting up set up the profile property update.

    7. Paste the new template code.
    8. You can then `preview` the email as one of your segment subscribers.
    9. Make sure to `Save` the changes and click `Done`.
    10. Return to your flow and turn your email `LIVE`.
    From that moment on, all the quiz takers, who leave their email, will be automatically added to your Kalviyo Segment and will be sent a follow-up email. 
    Remember to deactivate the [email Notifications](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/) from the Quiz Builder once the Klaviyo flow is set up.
    If you want to send an email with each quiz retake, you can do that by adding a `Profile property update` action at the end of the flow. Follow these steps:
    1. Add a `Profile property update` action at the end of the flow.
    2. Click `+ Step`.
    3. Select `Delete existing property`.

        - different question types and how to use them
        - how to recall information from the previous questions

    <div class="videoWrapper">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nVR8slJPSpY?si=6l2Vvz7i73IpJqzB" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
    1. Let's add a new quiz from your [dashboard](/reference/dashboard/).
    2. [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) is where you'll create your quiz. 
    3. Click on the `+` plus sign and choose a question type. 
    4. You can edit the question and you'll see how it looks in the preview.
    5. To change [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings), click on :material-wrench:, a little wrench icon. Here, you can change things like adding a question description or an image.
    6. To make the quiz more personal you can add a `Name question` and recall the answer in other parts of the quiz using [information recalls (@)](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/).
    7. To select the best cleanser, you may want to know the client's age, skin type and the environment they live in. `Multiple-choice questions` may be the best way to find out this information. Let's ask about a skin type. 
    8. Finally, we should find out the environment they live in. To make the quiz more interesting, we'll use a `Picture question` here. 
    9. Don't forget to add an `email question`! That's how you'll collect valuable leads for your marketing campaigns. In the [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings) you can make this one optional.
    10. Once you have all your questions you can move them around by drag and drop. 
    11. Make sure to keep the quiz short. Customers typically drop out after question 8 and almost nobody gets to question 12. There's power in simplicity!
    1. You can change the look of your quiz in the [Quiz Design](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/) tab.
    2. In the [My Themes gallery](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/#my-themes), you'll see some premade themes that you can choose from.
    3. Or you can create your own design by clicking [Edit Theme](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/#edit-theme).
    4. To make the quiz match the store's style let's:
        - edit the font, 
        - change the background color, 
        - remove or add a background image, 
        - and change the color of the buttons and choices. 
    5. You can even [add custom CSS code](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/#add-custom-css-code) to make the quiz unique.
    6. All the changes you make will be saved automatically.
    7. Once you're done, you can change the name of your theme and it will be saved in [My Themes gallery](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/#my-themes). You'll be able to apply it to other quizzes that you create.
    1. Our [success checklist](/reference/dashboard/#success-checklist) will remind you if there are no products associated with the answers.
    2. To add a product, go to the [Link Products](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) tab and click on the blank space after the answer.
    3. Your synced products will appear as a list. Scroll down to select items or just start typing the name.
    4. Multiple products can be assigned to the same answer.
    5. Product Recommendation Quiz works like a [voting system](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/). 
        - Products are linked to each choice. 
        - When a customer picks that choice, all linked products receive one vote.
        - After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the products sorted by the number of votes.
        - If there is a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the products.
    6. Make sure to link products to each question and choice in the quiz. 
    7. You can test different answering routes and results by clicking on the `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz and then `Preview`.
    1. Just like in the Quiz Builder, you can add multiple sections to your [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/). 
    2. Click on a `+` plus sign to select a block type. 
        - In `content blocks`, you can write insightful information about the product recommended.
        - With an `image block`, you can add your brand's logo.
        - In the `Products block`, you can select how many products will be recommended. 
    3. You can use the [Markdown language](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/) to make your quiz pop. Markdowns allow you to add **boldness** or *emphasis* to your text but also insert links, images, and videos. For more information about the Markdown language, check our [How-To documentation](/how-to-guides/) section.
    4. The [Result Page settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) allow you to further customize the quiz with a background image.
    1. Once your quiz is set up, hit the [`Share`](/reference/quiz-builder/share-publish/) button in the top right-hand corner to see all of the publishing options.
    2. For example, you can [embed a link to the quiz in your website's menu](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-link#link-popup-in-website-menu).
    3. Adjust the quiz's width and height and generate a code. 
    4. In your website's menu, you can add a new section and paste the code. 
    Voila!  You've just created your first Product Recommendation Quiz.

# Editing Quiz Design

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

With the RevenueHunt Quiz app, you have complete control over how your quiz looks and feels. Design settings are available at multiple levels, from global styles that affect the whole quiz to question/block-level tweaks for individual elements. This guide will walk you through every place where you can customize your quiz design.
    !!! info "You‚Äôll learn:"
        - how to use the customization options in the Quiz Design tab or built-in Question, Block or Results Page settings
        - where to add your own style with CSS or JavaScript
        - how to modify any part of the quiz or results page with custom CSS
        - how to include custom images and styles for each question via the question settings
        - how to add videos to the quiz or results page via the question settings
    Design customization in RevenueHunt works at several levels:
    - The [Quiz Design](#quiz-design-tab) tab gives you global control over fonts, colors, and navigation.
    - The [Quiz Builder](#questions-tab) tab lets you style each slide and its blocks individually.
    - The [Results Page](#results-page-tab) tab ensures your final recommendations match your brand.
    - Every **slide and block** has its own options for fine-tuning.
    - And when you need full control, **custom CSS** and **JavaScript** are available at every step.
    The **Quiz Design** tab is your main hub for styling the quiz. Use it to set fonts, colors, backgrounds, and global CSS.
    **Basic customizations**
    - Open the Quiz Builder and navigate to the [Quiz Design](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/) tab.
    - Customize the look. Start from a pre-designed theme in **My Themes** or make your own.
        ![manual_quizbuilder_quizdesign_mythemes](/images/manual_quizbuilder_quizdesign_mythemes.png){width="300"}
    - **Edit Theme**. Pick a color palette, choose fonts, and add a default background image.
        ![manual_quizbuilder_quizdesign_edittheme](/images/manual_quizbuilder_quizdesign_edittheme.png){width="300"}
    **Theme editor fields**
    - In the Quiz Design tab, you‚Äôll see the name of your current theme displayed at the top.
    - Use the **Font** dropdown to change fonts for headings and body text, or select Inherit to automatically match your store theme.
    - Adjust the question **text color** with a color picker, or type in a HEX code for precision.
    - Change the **look of choices** with the built-in color picker. Like other fields, you can paste in a HEX code for an exact match.
    - Style your quiz **buttons** (Start, Next, Add to Cart, etc.) by selecting a background color.
    - Set a global **background** color or upload a background image (recommended max size 1000√ó1000px, ‚â§2 MB). Once added, extra options for positioning and alignment will appear.
        ![how_to_improve_image_quality_backgroudimagequiz](/images/how_to_improve_image_quality_backgroudimagequiz.png)
    - Use the **Background Opacity** slider to fade the image slightly and keep text readable.
    **Publish changes**
    - Click the `Publish` (top-right) button to apply changes to the live/preview quiz.
    You can style any element of your quiz or results page using the built-in CSS console in the Quiz Design tab.
    - Open your quiz and go to the [Quiz Design](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/) tab.
    - In the Custom CSS section, click `Add` to open the CSS console. This will create an input area where you or your developer can add rules that override the default quiz styles.
    - To find the correct selector, right-click on the element in your browser and choose `Inspect`. Copy the selector from the developer tools.
    !!! tip "Add specificity to your CSS rules"
        Add specificity to your CSS rules to target the whole quiz or just one question.
        `#quiz p {color: red;}` - Changes the color of all paragraphs in the quiz.
        `#question-AbC7Zde p {color: red;}` - Changes the color of a paragraph only in question AbC7Zde.
        You can find the `question ID` in [Quiz Builder > Question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).
    In the [Quiz Buider](/reference/quiz-builder/) tab, you can design each question/slide. 
    **Question Settings**
    Click on the `wrench icon` in the bottom-right corner to open the [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).
    In question setting you'll find many options to customize your question and make it very unique. 
    - **Show description** - Activates an extra text field on the slide below the main question field. Allows you to add more text to a slide. Toggle to activate.
        !!! info "Show description"
            ![tutorial_legacy_question_description_example](/images/tutorial_legacy_question_description_example.png)
            Description fields are very useful as they not only allow you to add extra text to the slide but also style it using the [Markdown](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/) language, embed images and videos using [Markdown](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/) or use [information recalls](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) to display the user's previous answers.
    - **Image** - Click `Add` to uplaod a featured image to the question. Image should be max 1000px x 1000px. An extra menu appears once activated. You can choose the image position and adjust the opacity.
        ![how_to_improve_image_quality_backgroudimagequestion](/images/how_to_improve_image_quality_backgroudimagequestion.png)
    - **Video** - Click `Add` to uplaod a featured video to the question. An extra menu appears once activated. You can choose the video position and adjust the opacity.
    - **Join next question**- Allows you to join the current question with the next one.
        !!! example
            ![how_to_join_slides_slides_joined](/images/how_to_join_slides_slides_joined.png)
    - **Custom JS Code** - Click `Add` to open a JavaScript console. Allows you to add custom JavaScript to the quiz question.
        !!! tip "Custom JavaScript"
            You can add custom JavaScript to **questions** and the [**results page**](#results-page-tab) to extend behavior and layout.
            **Use cases**
            - Inject custom texts, images, and conditional UI.
            - Adjust layout dynamically.
            - Render custom product recommendations.
            - Redirect to a specific store page.
            - Fire tracking on specific steps (GA, Meta Pixel, etc.).
            See [How to Add JavaScript to the Quiz](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) for implementation details and best practices.
    **Adding Media**
    You can add media into quiz questions in two ways:
    1. **Per-question media** via [**Question Settings**](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings): Upload a unique image per slide (background or split) or add a short **video** block for richer context.
        ![how_to_improve_image_quality_picturechoicequestions](/images/how_to_improve_image_quality_backgroudimagequestion.png)
    2. **Embed via Markdown** in text blocks such as question description or content blocks on the results page:
        !!! example "Markdown"
            - **Images**
            ```
            ![alt text](https://www.example.com/path/to/image.jpg)
            ```
            - **Videos**
            ```
            ![](https://youtu.be/0_tO8HgJiLQ)
            ```
    !!! tip "Tip"
        See [How to Add/Adjust Images](/how-to-guides/add-adjust-images/) for optimization guidance (dimensions, compression, readability).
    **Styling Text**
    For quick formatting, you can use **Markdown** inside text blocks (questions, choices, results).
    !!! example "Using Markdown"
        **Headings**
        ```
        # H1
        ## H2
        ### H3
        ```
        **Text styles**
        ```
        *italic*  
        **bold**  
        ***bold & italic***
        ```
        **Links**
        ```
        [link title](https://www.example.com)
        ```
        **Images**
        ```
        ![alt text](https://www.example.com/path/to/image.jpg)
        ```
        **Videos**
        ```
        ![](https://youtu.be/0_tO8HgJiLQ)
        ```
    !!! tip "Need brand fonts/colors?"
        Use [**Custom CSS**](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/#advanced-customizations-css) in the [Quiz Design](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/) tab.
    **Picture Choice Slides**
    You can add a Picture Choice question to your quiz, which will allow you to add an image to each choice in that multiple choice question.

# Sedning Emails with RevenueHunt app

--- Shopify (Legacy) Specific Content ---

In these tutorials, you‚Äôll learn how to send emails to quiz respondents and yourself using the RevenueHunt app and how to connect your own email server using SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) .
    !!! info "You‚Äôll learn:"
        - how to send quiz result emails to customers automatically,
        - how to receive a notification email when someone completes a quiz,
        - how to connect your own email server using SMTP.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/59f5f73b491545fe85b6a3aaeb025bf1?sid=e7fd0e9f-c795-460b-969b-5b94226c0876" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    1. **Add Your SMTP Credentials**: Go to [`App Settings > SMTP`](/reference/app-settings/#smtp) and provide your email SMTP credentials. Follow [these instruction](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails-from-custom-server/) to learn how to set this up.
        ![manual_appsettings_smtp](/images/manual_appsettings_smtp.png)
        !!! note
            SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. SMTP is a connection protocol that enables third-party apps (e.g. RevenueHunt) to send emails through your email server.
            When you connect the RevenueHunt app to your SMTP Server, the follow-up emails with the quiz results that are sent to your customers will be sent from your email account.
            <b>If you're unsure what credentials to use, check your email provider's documentation (look for "SMTP") or contact their customer support.</b>
    1. **Add Email Question**: Before you set up your result emails, you need to make sure that the quiz has an email question. To add an email question go to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/).
    2. **Activate Respondent Emails**: Go to [`Notifications > TO RESPONDENT`](/reference/quiz-builder/notifications/#to-respondent) and toggle the `Send email when someone completes the quiz` button to activate the emails.
        ![how to activate to respondent emails](/images/manual_quizbuilder_notifications_torespondent_active.png)
    3. **Edit REPLY-TO**: Choose what email the customers will be able to reply to once they recieve the results.
    4. **Email TO**: If you have more than one email question in your quiz, choose an answer to which email question should be used to send the result emails. If you have only one email question, it will be selected by default.
    5. **Email Subject**: Edit the title of the email that customers will receive. You can use `@` to [recall information](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) such as the customer name or the quiz name in the title field.
    5. **Edit Email Content**: Configure the email your customers will receive. You can choose between a **Basic (text)** email format or **Advanced (HTML)** email format. You can switch between the two by clicking `switch to advanced HTML message` or `switch to basic text message` in the `Email Text Message` field.
        - **Basic text** email template is easy to use. Type the text that you want the customer to see in the `Email Text Message` field. You can personalize the email subject and content. You can add dynamic elements with `@`. Use `@` / [Information Recalls](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) to recall quiz information in the email body. You can recall data such as customer name, email, phone number, quiz name, question responses, recommended products and more. Basic email template does not allow the display of images or color customization but offers maximum deliverability.
        ![how to send result emails basic tempalte](/images/manual_quizbuilder_notifications_torespondent_active_basic.png)
        - **Advanced HTML** email template requires the knowledge of HTML and [Handlebars helpers](https://github.com/helpers/handlebars-helpers) to be edited. Incorporate quiz response metadata like `{{first_name}}` to personalize emails. You can use Handlebars to loop through and display recommended products or customize content based on quiz outcomes. Note that HTML emails are not rendered the same in different email clients and that you should add styles inline, not as classes. You also can‚Äôt add JavaScript code since it won‚Äôt be executed by email clients. Read more about styling Advanced HTML Email temapltes [here](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/#editing-email-templates).
        ![how to send result emails html template](/images/manual_quizbuilder_notifications_torespondent_active_html.png)
    6. **Publish the changes**: Remember to publish the changes with the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/4f81409e7c704226baa5e7d57d3a5d00?sid=943b1e1b-9aee-4680-af9f-17707623df33" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

        - **SMTP Port**: Enter the port number (e.g., `587`) as specified by your email provider's configuration.
        SMTP settings vary by email provider. To find your settings:
        - Search your email provider's documentation for 'SMTP'.
        - Visit [Specific SMTP Configurations](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails-from-custom-server/#specific-smtp-configurations) for common email provider instructions.
        - Contact your email provider's support team for assistance.
        !!! note
            If you're not sure how to fill it in, try contacting your email service provider or check their documentation (search for "SMTP" on the documentation page).
    4. **Test and Activate**: Click on `test connection & activate`. If the test is succsefull, from now on all the emails will be sent from your server. 
        If there are errors, please check the [troubleshooting guidelines](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails-from-custom-server/#troubleshooting-common-smtp-connection-issues).

    </div>
    If you run a cosmetics shop you may want to recommend a full routine to your customers instead of singular products. With the RevenueHunt app, it is possible to group products into slots and recommend a product for each step in your beauty routine.
    !!! tip
        Check out our [Skincare Quiz Demo](https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/) site and take the quiz to see an example.
    **Objective**: In this tutorial, you‚Äôll learn how to build a quiz that recommends a four-step skincare routine to your customers.
    Let‚Äôs get started.
    1. In the [Skincare Quiz Demo](https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/) shop, there are four types of skincare products: cleansers, toners, serums, and moisturizers. 
    2. For the slots to work correctly, you‚Äôll have to **create four collections** and include all the corresponding products in them. For example:
        - a *Cleansers* collection should have all the cleansing products, 
        - a *Toners* collection should have all the toning products, 
        - a *Serums* collection should have all the serums, etc.
    3. To create a collection, click on the top-right button. Check [this article](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/collections) for detailed instructions on managing collections in Shopify.
    4. Give it a name and a description. 
    5. Next, you‚Äôll select how to add products to a collection. You can do that **manually**, selecting each product one by one, or you can make an **automatic collection** based on a product tag. 
    6. To create a *Cleansers* collection, we‚Äôll choose the tag to be equal to the word `cleanser`. Shopify will automatically add all the products with this tag to the collection. 
    7. You can create the toners, serums and moisturizer collections the same way.
    8. You can have more than one collection that includes some of the same products. An *anti-aging* or *oily skin* collection can be composed of several cleansers, serums or moisturizers.
    Once you‚Äôve made changes to your products and collections, you should [sync them](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/) with the app. 
    1. The process is done automatically in the background but to make it faster, you can hit the [sync button](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/) in the [Success Checklist](/reference/dashboard/#success-checklist).
    2. The sync may take between 30 to 60 minutes.
    3. Once it‚Äôs finished, all your products and collections will be up to date in the app.
    !!! info
        Your store is also fully synced every 24 hours.
    Now you can build your quiz. 
    1. You can start from scratch or use one of our [pre-designed Skincare templates](/reference/dashboard/#new-quiz).
        !!! tip
            Check out our [previous step-by-step tutorial](/tutorials/making-first-quiz/) to learn how to use the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/).
    2. Start building the quiz by [adding simple questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-types) relevant to the customer.
        - Use a `Name question` to make the quiz personal.
        - `Multiple-choice questions` can be useful in finding out the client‚Äôs age, skin type, skin concerns or the environment they live in.
        - Additionally, a skin sensitivity question will be added. In the [next section](#exclude-products) of this tutorial, you‚Äôll learn how to [exclude products](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/#exclusion) containing allergens from your recommendations.
        - Finish the quiz with an `email question`. Quiz responses can be sent to your mailing list or CRM for segmented retargeting.
    1. In the [Quiz Design](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/) tab, you can change the look and feel of the quiz.
    2. You can even [add custom CSS code](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/#add-custom-css-code) to make it pop.
    Once your quiz is built and styled, you should add products and collections to individual choices.
    1. To do that, go to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and open the [Link Collections/Categories](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/) tab. 
    2. For the age question, you can link the *youth* and *anti-aging* collections/categories created earlier.
    3. Then, let‚Äôs link the *skin type* collections/categories.
    4. You can link one or more collections/categories to the same choice.
    5. Continue like this and make sure that each choice in the quiz has products or collections/categories linked, otherwise you may end up with empty results.
    !!! info "Product recommendation algorithm"
        The product recommendation algorithm works like a [voting system](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/). 
        - Products are linked to each choice.
        - When a customer picks that choice all the linked products receive one vote.
        - This includes all the products inside the linked collection. 
        - At the end, the results page will show slots with products sorted by the number of votes.
    Remember the sensitivity question asked at the end of the quiz? To remove harmful products from the recommendations use the [`exclude products`](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/#exclusion) feature. 
    1. To exclude a product go to the [Link Products](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) tab and select a question. 
    2. Tap on the greyed `exclude products` text and a white bar will appear. 
    3. Simply add the products that contain an allergen.
    Now, when a customer says he‚Äôs sensitive to *aloe vera*, all the products that contain it will be excluded from the possible recommendations. 
    !!! warning
        ‚ùóBe careful when using exclusions. Once a product has been excluded it won't show on the results page, even if it was upvoted in another question.
    It‚Äôs time to edit the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/). 
    1. Add a heading, a logo or a content block to customize the page.
        !!! tip
            Check the [previous tutorial](/tutorials/making-first-quiz/) to see examples of different blocks being used.
    2. To make the page more attractive, let‚Äôs add a `content block`. In this block, we‚Äôll describe every step in the beauty routine. 
    3. Remember to use [Markdown language](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/) to style your text. 
    The page is almost done. 
    Now let‚Äôs add a space for products.
    1. As a skincare store, you‚Äôd like to recommend a routine composed of a cleanser, a toner, a serum, and a moisturizer.
    2. Use `+` to add a `Product Slots Block` and create four different slots for each of the products. 
    3. In [product slot settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) you can:
        - Edit the slot name, 
        - Add a description,
        - And select how many products should be recommended in each slot.
    4. Slots won‚Äôt work unless you `include collections/categories` to each of them. It‚Äôs how they know which products to choose.
        - Include the *Cleansers* collection/category in the Cleansers Slot
        - Include the *Toners* collection/category in the Toners Slot
        - Include the *Serums* collection/category in the Serum Slot, etc.
    5. Make sure that the products in these collections/categories are [linked to the answers](#link-collections) in the quiz. Otherwise, the slots will produce empty results.
    6. Follow the same steps to create a morning routine.
    Et voila! You‚Äôve just created a dynamic result page for your beauty quiz!
    1. Update the preview/live quiz with the top-right `Publish` button.
    2. You can test the quiz by clicking the `Preview`/`Test Quiz` button.
    3. Take the quiz a few times to check if the correct products are recommended.
    Now you‚Äôre ready to publish the quiz on your website. Let‚Äôs add it [inline with a new page](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-inline/#embedding-an-inline-quiz-on-a-new-page). 
    1. To do that, go to the [`Share`](/reference/quiz-builder/share-publish/) tab and select the `Inline` publish option.
    2. Click `Show Instructions for Legacy Themes`.
    3. Adjust the quiz‚Äôs width and height and click `Get code` to generate a code. 
    3. Copy the code and navigate to your `Online Store > Pages` in Shopify. 
    4. Add a new page and give it a name. 
    5. Click the `Show HTML` button and paste the code copied from the app.
    6. Make sure to `save` the changes.
