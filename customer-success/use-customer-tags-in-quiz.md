        ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_customertags](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_customertags.png)

        !!! tip
            If you want all the quiz takers to have a specific tag, you can add it to the all the choices in one of the questions in the quiz. This way no matter which choice they select, they will have the tag.

    4. **Save changes**: Click the "Save" button to apply your changes. Tags will be automatically applied to customers when they select the corresponding choice.
    5. **Preview the quiz**: Preview the quiz to verify that the tags have been added correctly to the quiz responses.

            Tags sent to responses will also be forwarded to any connected [integrations](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/).

            For example, if integrated with Shopify Customers List, customer tags will be sent to customer profiles in Shopify. If quiz is integrated with Klaviyo, customer tags will be sent to Klaviyo, etc.

## How to use Customer Tags?
 

Imagine a haircare store that offers a wide range of products including shampoos, conditioners, hair treatments, styling products, and more. 

The store uses the RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz to help customers find the best products based on their hair type, concerns, and goals. 

Here’s how they can use customer tags for a segmented marketing campaign in Klaviyo:

### 1️⃣ Create the Quiz

Create a quiz with questions about hair type (e.g., curly, straight, wavy), hair concerns (e.g., dandruff, dryness, frizz), and hair goals (e.g., volume, shine, repair). Make sure to add an email question as the last slide.

![how to use customer tags in product quizzes to maximize sales](/images/cs_customer_tags_example_quizbuilder.png)   

!!! example "Sample Quiz"

    <script src="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/embed.js" async></script>
    <div class="rh-widget rh-inline" data-url="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/7jHqBA" style="margin: 10px auto; width: 100%; height: 600px; display: flex;"></div>



### 2️⃣ Create and Link Customer Tags to Choices

As customers answer these questions, assign relevant tags such as *“Curly Hair,”* *“Dry Hair,”* *“Volume,”* *“Anti-Frizz,”* and *“Repair”* to the choices in the quiz. 

![how to use customer tags in product quizzes to maximize sales](/images/cs_customer_tags_example_hair_tags.png)

Check the [Choice Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings) section to add customer tags to choices.

### 3️⃣ Connect Quiz to Klaviyo

Connect the quiz to Klaviyo following [these instructions](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/).

Once the quiz is connected, customer tags from the RevenueHunt app are automatically sent to Klaviyo along with customer choices and recommendations. This allows Klaviyo to receive and store tags linked to each customer profile.

### 4️⃣ Create Segments in Klaviyo

In Klaviyo, create segments based on the tags.

![how to use customer tags in product quizzes to maximize sales](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kalviyo-segement-768x450.png)

For example:

- **Curly Hair Segment**: Customers coming from the quiz and tagged with “Curly Hair.”
- **Dry Hair Segment**: Customers coming from the quiz and tagged with “Dry Hair.”
- **Volume Goal Segment**: Customers coming from the quiz and tagged with “Volume.”
- **Anti-Frizz Segment**: Customers coming from the quiz and tagged with “Anti-Frizz.”
- **Repair Segment**: Customers coming from the quiz and tagged with “Repair.”

### 5️⃣ Design Tailored Email Campaigns

Create [email flows/campaigns](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002774932) specifically tailored to each segment in Kalviyo. When designing tailored email campaigns, it’s all about crafting messages that really speak to each customer segment’s unique needs and preferences.

Start by digging into the data from your customer tags to understand what makes each group tick. Create content that addresses their specific interests and personalize your subject lines and email bodies to make them feel valued. Plan your campaign schedule carefully to keep people engaged without overwhelming them, and use automation to send timely, relevant emails based on their behavior.

For example:

- **Curly Hair Segment**: Send emails featuring products designed for curly hair, such as curl-enhancing shampoos and conditioners, and styling creams. Include tips for maintaining curly hair and exclusive offers on curl care bundles.
- **Dry Hair Segment**: Send emails promoting moisturizing shampoos, conditioners, and deep-conditioning treatments. Share tips on how to combat dry hair and offer discounts on hydrating product sets.
- **Volume Goal Segment**: Highlight volumizing shampoos, conditioners, and styling products. Include styling tips for achieving more volume and special promotions on volume-boosting kits.
- **Anti-Frizz Segment**: Focus on anti-frizz serums, creams, and treatments. Provide advice on managing frizz and offer deals on anti-frizz collections.
- **Repair Segment**: Promote reparative treatments, masks, and serums. Share insights on hair repair routines and exclusive offers on repair-focused products.
