## Plans & pricing details

### Feature availability for paid-only options

=== "Shopify"

    We encourage you to try and test all features you might need before committing to a paid plan. That's why we offer a free trial period, so you can explore our advanced features and see how they work for your business.

    The following features require a paid plan:

    - Add custom HTML, custom CSS, and custom JavaScript to quizzes
    - Add custom Chart.js charts
    - Integrate with GA4 and Meta Pixel
    - Integrate with Webhooks and Zapier
    - Integrate with Klaviyo, Omnisend, and other third-party integrations

    During your trial period, you can test them while on the Free plan. After the trial ends, you can still test them in the quiz preview and inside the quiz builder, but they won’t work on live quizzes until you upgrade to a paid plan.

### How quiz usage is calculated

=== "Shopify"

    - Every day, our billing system calculates the responses captured during the **past 30 days (rolling)**. Your plan is based on usage in retrospect. (Check how this works [here](#when-do-my-plan-responses-reset).)
    - If your quizzes receive more responses than your plan allows in the past 30 days, the app will prompt you to **upgrade to a higher plan**. Conversely, if your usage decreases, you can **downgrade to a lower plan**.
    - We offer **flexible upgrades** and charge only for the proportional days you've been on each plan each month.
    - If you need to **temporarily upgrade for a marketing campaign**, you can downgrade later if your usage decreases.
    - There's no limit to the number of quizzes you can create, even on the Free plan.

## Upgrading and downgrading plans

=== "Shopify"


    If you need to upgrade temporarily for a marketing campaign, you can downgrade later on to a smaller plan if your usage is lower. You can easily do it yourself from the [App Settings > Plans & Pricing](/reference/plans-pricing/) page in the app.

    Bear in mind that if you need to upgrade/downgrade we’re very flexible. When changing plans Shopify will automatically discount the proportional part of the monthly plan that hasn’t been used.

## How to cancel your billing

=== "Shopify"

    If you want to stop being charged for the RevenueHunt app, you have a few options:

    **Option 1: Downgrade to the Free plan**

    You can downgrade to our Free plan (which allows up to 100 responses per month) directly from the [Plans & Pricing tab](/reference/plans-pricing/) in the app. This will stop all billing charges.

    **If your current usage is below 100 responses in the past 30 days**: You can downgrade immediately and your billing will stop.

    **If your current usage exceeds 100 responses in the past 30 days**: You have two choices:

    - Wait until your usage drops below 100 responses in the past 30 days, then downgrade to the Free plan yourself.

    - Contact our [support team](/how-to-guides/contact-customer-support/) to downgrade for you. **Note**: This will immediately block your quizzes until your usage drops below the Free plan limit (100 responses in the past 30 days).

    **Option 2: Uninstall the app completely**

    If you no longer want to use the app at all, you can uninstall it from your platform:

    - **Shopify**: Go to your Shopify admin > Apps > RevenueHunt > Uninstall

    **Important**: Uninstalling the app will permanently delete all your quizzes, responses, and data within 48 hours. This action cannot be undone.

    If you have any questions about canceling or need help with the process, please [contact our support team](/how-to-guides/contact-customer-support/).

## What counts as a paid response?

Quiz Responses are counted as the number of people who have completed the quiz (reached the Results Page). If someone starts the quiz and abandons it partway through, this does not count as a response.

You can check your responses in the [Metrics > Analytics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#analytics) tab inside the Quiz Builder.

## When do my plan responses reset?

The way our billing system works is that every day it’s calculating the responses captured during the past 30 days (rolling), so the corresponding plan and the charges are made based on usage in retrospect.

You can check the Metrics -> Analytics panel to check how many responses your quiz received in the past 30 days.

—

It’s best to explain it based on an example. Let’s say that you are on a Basic plan which allows up to 500 responses per month. These are the number of responses you’ve gotten in the last 30 days:

![plans pricing faq explanation1](/images/plans_pricing_faq_explanation1.png)

So:

- On day 1, you got 32 answers
- On day 2 you got 16 answers
- On day 3 you got 0 answers, (so none at all) and so on.

If you check the “Total last 30 days” cell, that’s where we add the number of responses of the last 30 days. We get a total of 500 responses. This means your plan’s usage has reached its limit. Thus, the “Available Responses” is 0.

Now, when does this reset?

Let’s say, that the following day – you get 0 responses. The 30 days would “Roll”, and your table would look like this:

![plans pricing faq explanation2](/images/plans_pricing_faq_explanation2.png)

You’ll notice that ALL of the days were “bumped” 1 day back. For example, “Day 3” on the first table, is now on “Day 2”, “Day 4” is now “Day 3” and so on. Meaning, the usage of day 1 has rolled out, and as you haven’t got any new answers, now you have the 32 responses that you had previously on day #1 available – because the sum of your “new” table is only 468 (As the previous day 1 with 32 responses “rolled out”).

## Changing plans example

For further clarification: billing cycle =/= our measuring period. We don’t set a date on which we begin or end measuring, rather, we always measure the last 30 days, rolling.
 

If you pay on the 15th for a Basic plan, you have the ability to get 500 responses within the past 30 days. For example, on the 15th we will look back 30 days and we will count the number of responses you’ve received those days. On the 22nd, we will look back 30 days, and so on…  Take a look at the spreadsheet [explanation above](#when-do-my-plan-responses-reset).
 

In this example, if you pay on May 15th the Basic plan, and you have a surge of responses let’s say on the 10th – 28th of a month, the following will happen:

1. As soon as you’re near 90% of your plan’s usage (in the Basic plan, this means when you’ve accumulated 450 responses in the last 30 days) we will warn you and let you know you might reach 100% which will require upgrading your plan.
2. If the usage keeps being high and you cross your plan’s limit, we will also let you know. As mentioned before, we will never block your quiz immediately, you’ll have plenty of time to do so.
3. Let’s say you’re now over your Basic plan, as you have been receiving a lot of responses that make you stay over 500 responses (to learn how the responses accumulate, please check the article thread above). But you already got charged again for the Basic plan, as the 15th of the month has passed. Let’s say that we’re on the 20th of a month here.

This means that, if you upgrade immediately to a Pro plan (allows 1000 responses/30 days), Shopify will only charge for 6 days of your plan (as that’s how many days you’ve used your Basic plan since the 15th). Your new billing cycle will be on the 20th of each month. Now, you’re able to receive 1000 responses “within the last 30 days” on a Pro plan. If you upgraded on the 20th, we will look back 30 days, and we will count your responses. If you’re under 1000, you’re good to go.
 

In other words: if the Basic plan accepts around ~16 responses each day, the Pro plan will accept ~33 responses every day, without ever crossing the 1000 responses limit / rolling 30 days (16 * 30 = 500, 33 * 30 = 1000)

## Monthy vs yearly plan

=== "Shopify"
    

    If you’ve just installed the RevenueHunt app, it is advised to stay on a monthly plan for some time to check your quiz usage. 

    Once you’re sure of what your stable usage is in a month, you can choose to pay for a yearly plan upfront with a reduced monthly rate. To buy a yearly plan, navigate to the [Plans & Pricing tab](/reference/plans-pricing/) in the app and select the `Billing Period` to `Annualy`.



=== "Shopify (Legacy)"

    If you’ve just installed the RevenueHunt app, it is advised to stay on a monthly plan for some time to check your quiz usage. 

    Once you’re sure of what your stable usage is in a month, you can choose to pay for a yearly plan upfront with a reduced monthly rate. To buy a yearly plan, navigate to the [Plans & Pricing tab](/reference/plans-pricing/) in the app and select “show yearly”.

## Discounts

We offer a 50% discount on all plans if you subscribe for 2 years and you pay upfront. However, we do recommend starting with the monthly plan, for 2-3 months until you start getting results & sales, before committing to a 2-year plan.

## What's the difference between the WooCommerce extension and a WordPress plugin?

The [WordPress Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/product-recommendation-quiz-for-ecommerce/) is free to install and puts you directly on our **Free plan**. The Free plan allows up to 100 quiz responses per month without any charges but has a “Powered by RevenueHunt” branding. If your usage exceeds the Free plan, you’ll be asked to upgrade to a Basic plan which is billed monthly.

The [WooCommerce extension](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-recommendation-quiz-for-woocommerce/) requires a yearly subscription (29$/year) to install the app and puts you on a **Starter Plan**. The Starter Plan allows up to 250 quiz responses per month and has the “Powered by RevenueHunt” branding removed. If your usage exceeds the Starter plan, you’ll be asked to upgrade to a Basic plan which is billed monthly.
