# Why Your Product Quiz is NOT Converting Well

Product quizzes are a great way to personalize shopping experiences and boost sales, but sometimes they just don‚Äôt hit the mark. If your quiz isn‚Äôt converting as well as you‚Äôd like, you‚Äôre not alone.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jmjHlwEErI?si=a5bEg-I7CrPHPj7T" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

Here are some common reasons why your quiz is not working well and how you can fix it.

## üéØ  You Don‚Äôt Have Clear Goals

If you don‚Äôt know what you want your quiz to achieve, it‚Äôs hard to make it effective. Are you trying to *increase sales*, *gather customer data*, or just *engage your audience*?

Without a clear purpose, your quiz might miss the mark.

**Solution**

Decide what you want your quiz to do. For instance, if you want to boost sales, make sure your questions help guide users to only the products you know they‚Äôll love. Keep track of metrics that show you‚Äôre reaching your goals, like conversion rates and average order value.


| Goal | Solution |
|------|-----------|
| **Increasing Sales** | ‚Ä¢ `Define Sales Objectives`: Set specific targets, like increasing average order value or boosting conversion rates by X%.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Tailored Product Recommendations`: Ensure your quiz directs users to products they are more likely to buy based on their answers and that you don't show too many products on your results page (recommending 1 product that matches all customer criteria is best). |
| **Gathering Customer Data** | ‚Ä¢ `Focus on Insights`: Design questions that help you understand your customers' preferences and behaviors.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Data Collection`: Use the quiz to gather valuable information like email addresses, preferences, and pain points. You can easily [download all the quiz responses](/how-to-guides/download-quiz-responses/) or [connect your quiz to GA4](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) for advanced behavioral analytics. |
| **Engaging Your Audience** | ‚Ä¢ `Interactive Elements`: Include engaging and fun elements like images, videos, and gamified components. Visual quizzes maintain the customer's attention.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Entertainment and Informative Value`: Make sure the quiz is enjoyable and informative, keeping the audience interested but also feeling like they are learning something. |

## ü•± Your Questions Are Boring

If your quiz is boring, users won‚Äôt stick around to finish it. A dull design, lack of interactivity, and uninspiring content can all lead to low engagement.

Long, complex, or irrelevant questions can also drive users away. If your questions are too generic, they won‚Äôt provide a personalized experience.

**Solution**

Make your quiz visually appealing and interactive. Use images, videos, and animations to keep it interesting. Add elements like progress bars and instant feedback to make the experience more fun.

![visually appealing and interactive quiz](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-10-090342-e1720595102774.png)

Keep your questions short, sweet, and to the point. Make sure they‚Äôre relevant to what your customers care about. Use simple language and avoid jargon. Every question should help you understand your customers better or steer them toward the right product.

| Goal | Solution |
|------|-----------|
| **Increasing Sales** | ‚Ä¢ `Interactive Elements`: Use interactive questions and features to keep users interested.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Relevant Questions, Direct Path to Purchase`: Ask only questions that help narrow down the best products for the user. Ensure questions are geared towards identifying products that fit the user's needs.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Product Highlights`: Showcase product benefits and unique selling points throughout the product description in the quiz. |
| **Gathering Customer Data** | ‚Ä¢ `Fun Questions`: Make data-gathering questions fun and engaging.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Rewards for Participation`: Offer incentives for completing the quiz, like [discounts](/how-to-guides/add-discount/) or entries into a giveaway.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Insightful Queries`: Include questions that provide deeper insights into customer preferences and demographics.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Progressive Profiling`: Gradually gather more detailed information with each quiz interaction. |
| **Engaging Your Audience** | ‚Ä¢ `Entertaining Questions`: Use questions that are fun and engaging, such as personality-based or lifestyle questions.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Gamification`: Incorporate elements of gamification, such as progress bars and badges.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Visual Appeal`: Incorporate images and videos to make questions more interesting.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Storytelling`: Use a narrative approach to make the quiz more engaging. |

!!! tip "Tip: Use Picture Questions"

    Use [Picture Questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) to add images or animated gifs to your quiz choices in the RevenueHunt quiz app.

!!! tip "Tip: Upload Images and Videos"

    You can upload [images and videos](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/#adding-images-and-videos) to any quiz question in the RevenueHunt quiz app.


## ü§î Your Results Are Too Generic

If you recommend too many products to the customer, they still will not know what to put in their cart. Recommending too many products ads an extra decision step in the customer‚Äôs shopping journey.

If your quiz results aren‚Äôt personalized, users will feel like they wasted their time. Generic results won‚Äôt make users excited about your products.

**Solution**

Recommend a single product that matches all the customer criteria or a full routine with one product per step. This way the customer will know what to add to cart right away and it will significantly increase your conversion rate.

![single product recommendation](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-10-090001.png)

Use the data from the quiz to give personalized recommendations. Make sure the results are specific to each user‚Äôs answers. Highlight why these products are perfect for them.

| Goal | Solution |
|------|-----------|
| **Increasing Sales** | ‚Ä¢ `Personalized Recommendations`: Provide highly tailored product suggestions based on quiz answers.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Highlight Benefits`: Clearly explain why each recommended product is a great fit for the user. |
| **Gathering Customer Data** | ‚Ä¢ `Detailed Insights`: Offer results that give users a deep understanding of their preferences and needs.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Encourage Profile Completion`: Use results to prompt users to complete their profiles for even more personalized recommendations. |
| **Engaging Your Audience** | ‚Ä¢ `Interactive Results`: Make the results page interactive, with clickable elements that lead to more content or products.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Shareable Outcomes`: Create results that are fun to share on social media, increasing engagement. |

## üì¢ Weak Calls to Action (CTAs)

If your CTAs aren‚Äôt clear or strong, users might not know what to do next. This can lead to missed conversions.

**Solution**

Make your CTAs clear and direct. Whether it‚Äôs ‚ÄúShop Now,‚Äù ‚ÄúLearn More,‚Äù or ‚ÄúGet Your Results,‚Äù make sure users know what to do next. Experiment with different texts and placements to see what works best.



| Goal | Solution |
|------|-----------|

| **Engaging Your Audience** | ‚Ä¢ `Engagement CTAs`: Use CTAs that encourage further interaction, like "Take Another Quiz" or "Read More Tips."<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Social Sharing`: Include CTAs that prompt users to share their results on social media. |


!!! tip "Tip: Change CTAs"

    You can change the text of any button or CTA in your quiz in the [Quiz Settings > Messages](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#messages) section or directly in each question settings.


## üíå No Follow-Up

The interaction shouldn‚Äôt end with the quiz results. If you don‚Äôt follow up, you miss out on potential sales and customer relationships.

**Solution**

Have a follow-up plan. Send personalized emails with the quiz results, product recommendations, and special offers.

Use retargeting ads to remind users about their quiz results and encourage them to come back.


| Goal | Solution |
|------|-----------|
| **Increasing Sales** | ‚Ä¢ `Email Follow-Ups`: [Send personalized emails](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/) with product recommendations based on quiz results.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Special Offers`: Include exclusive [discounts](/how-to-guides/add-discount/) or offers in the follow-up to encourage purchases. |
