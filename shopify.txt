# Adapt Product Quizzes for Different Markets and Languages

When a shopper lands on your store, they instantly notice two things:  

*Does this feel made for me?* and *Can I trust it?*  

![adapt quizzes to markets image1](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Quizzes-for-markets.png)

If your quiz greets a French customer in English, shows dollars instead of euros, or asks questions that feel out of place in their culture, you lose that moment of connection.  

Adapting your quizzes for different markets and languages is not just a technical detail ‚Äî it‚Äôs a way of saying **you belong here**.

---

## The Case for Localization

Think of your quiz as a digital salesperson.  
A good salesperson doesn‚Äôt speak the same script to everyone ‚Äî they adapt depending on who‚Äôs in front of them.

- In Spain, friendliness and warmth can make people more comfortable sharing information.  
- In Germany, clarity and compliance cues (like showing ‚Äúper 100ml‚Äù pricing) reassure customers that your brand is professional.  

    !!! tip "Tip: Product Metafields"
    
        To show the ‚Äúgrundpreis‚Äù or `per 100ml` price for cosmetic products RevenueHunt app allows you to show these values by automatically [syncing the metafields/attributes](/how-to-guides/add-product-metafields/) of products from your store.

- In the US, speed and incentives (‚ÄúTake this 45-second quiz for 10% off‚Äù) tend to drive engagement.

The same quiz, copied and pasted across all markets, misses those nuances. A localized quiz, on the other hand, feels natural ‚Äî and customers reward that effort with higher engagement and stronger conversions.


!!! info "Shopify Markets Support"

    The `üíé Built for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app fully supports the Shopify Markets feature allowing you to assign quizzes to different markets and languages quickly and easily.

## What Changes When You Localize

Localization isn‚Äôt just swapping languages. It touches multiple layers of the experience:

**Language and tone.** A casual ‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs find your skincare match‚Äù might resonate in the US, while a more polished tone may feel appropriate in Japan.  

**Visuals.** Even colors carry meaning. Red signals good fortune in China but can imply danger in Western markets.  

**Currency and pricing.** Showing euros to a German customer instead of USD removes an instant layer of friction.  

**Legal requirements.** Some regions enforce very specific rules ‚Äî like GDPR consent in Europe or advertising standards in Canada.  

Together, these details tell your customers: *we understand you, and we built this experience for you*.

---

## The Business Payoff

Brands that localize their quizzes consistently see three wins:

1. **More completed quizzes.** People stick with what feels familiar and relevant.  
2. **Higher conversions.** Clear pricing and tailored recommendations reduce hesitation.  
3. **Deeper customer loyalty.** When someone feels seen, they‚Äôre far more likely to come back.

And there‚Äôs a side benefit: you gather **better data**. Localized quizzes reveal what customers in France care about versus what drives decisions in Australia. That‚Äôs market research you can act on.

## Tips for a Smooth Rollout

!!! tip "Check our tutorial"

    If you want the technical ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù on assigning quizzes to Shopify Markets, we‚Äôve got you covered here:  
    üëâ [Tutorial: Assign Quizzes to Shopify Markets and Languages](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/tutorials/shopify-markets/)

Start small. Choose your top two or three markets, duplicate your best-performing quiz, and adapt it. Don‚Äôt try to cover the globe in one sprint.  

Keep branding consistent. Customers should recognize your brand instantly, even if the tone shifts slightly to match local expectations.  

Test in the wild. The in-app preview won‚Äôt show market differences, so you‚Äôll need to publish and actually change your store region or language to see what customers see.  

Plan for upkeep. Quizzes aren‚Äôt ‚Äúset and forget.‚Äù Product lines evolve, translations need polishing, and regulations shift. Build localization into your ongoing operations, not as a one-off project.

---

A localized quiz does more than recommend products. It builds trust across borders, increases conversions, and turns your store into a brand that feels truly global.  

But remember: the real success lies not in the setup, but in the mindset.   Localization is the difference between saying *we sell everywhere* and *we care everywhere*.

# Smart Ways to Ask for Marketing/Data Processing Consent in the Quiz

Marketing and data processing is crucial for building trust and ensuring compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA. For ecommerce platforms, especially those in the beauty sector, product recommendation quizzes offer a unique and engaging way to collect valuable customer data. However, asking for consent must be done thoughtfully to avoid deterring users.

Here are smart, user-friendly strategies to ask for marketing and data processing consent in your RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz.

## First Consider **When** to Ask
The best way to ask for email/phone marketing consent is to make it a natural part of the quiz flow. Instead of presenting it as a standalone request, weave it into the narrative of the quiz. There are two approaches on when to ask for marketing consent and both will affect your quizzes drop-off rate/ completion rate:

### üëã Before the Quiz Begins

Start with a friendly welcome message that explains the benefits of taking the quiz. Mention that by providing consent, users will receive personalized recommendations and exclusive offers.

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent before the quiz begins](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent-start-quiz-1024x732.png)


Asking for consent before the quiz starts will lead to **lower quiz completions** and higher drop off at the beginning but will provide **more quality leads** and filter clients genuenly interested in your products. This approach is better for merchants selling unique and luxury items.

### üñêÔ∏è At the End

At a strategic point, such as before showing the results, include a consent request. Make it part of a question about communication preferences. This creates a sunk-time-cost fallaciy in the mind of the customer and they are more likely to leave their data just to see the results.

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent at the end](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent-end-quiz-e1718952561212-1024x702.png)

Asking for consent at the end of the quiz will lead to a **lower drop-off** at this point since the customer is already invested in the experience. This will lead to higher completion rates and eventually **higher conversions** and upselling success. This approach is better for merchants selling inexpensive items or routines.

It is not recommended to ask for email or marketing data mid-way through the quiz as this only increases your quiz drop-off rate.

## Next, if it should be **Optional** or **Mandatory**

Whether you make your email/phone number question mandatory or optional will also have a huge impact on your quiz drop-off and conversion rate.

### ‚õî Mandatory

Making the email/phone consent question mandatory ensures that you collect contact information from every user who completes the quiz. This can be beneficial for building a robust email list quickly. However, it may also deter some users from completing the quiz if they are not comfortable sharing their information.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Ensures a high volume of data collection | May increase quiz drop-off rates. May include many fake emails. |
| Filters out less engaged users, potentially leading to higher-quality leads | Some users may find it intrusive and opt-out early |


### ‚úÖ Optional

Making the email/phone consent question optional can create a more user-friendly experience, encouraging more users to complete the quiz. This approach respects user privacy and autonomy, potentially leading to higher overall quiz engagement.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Higher quiz completion rates | Lower volume of data collection |
| Users feel less pressured, leading to a more positive brand experience | May require additional incentives to encourage users to opt-in |

!!! tip "Tip: Make Question Optional"

    In RevenueHunt app you can choose if a quiz question should be mandatory or optional in [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).


## Then **How** to Ask for Marketing Consent

Clear and honest communication is key to gaining trust when asking for marketing consent. Here‚Äôs how to do it effectively:

###1Ô∏è‚É£ Use Transparent Wording

**Simplify your message** to avoid legal jargon and make it easy to understand. **Highlight the benefits** users gain by consenting, such as exclusive content, discounts, or early access to new products. Usually, Yes/No questions are straightforward and reduce friction in the consent process. Ask direct yes/no questions regarding consent to make it easy for users to make a choice..

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent friendly and transparent wording](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent-simple-language1.png)

!!! tip "Tip: Use a GDPR/Question"
    Use a GDPR/Yes-No Question type to easily ask for consent in RevenueHunt app.

**Example**: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd love to stay in touch to share the best skincare tips and product updates. Do we have your permission to send you emails?‚Äù or ‚ÄúGet the most out of our recommendations! Sign up for our newsletter to receive special offers and expert skincare advice.‚Äù or ‚ÄúDo you agree to receive our personalized product recommendations and updates? [ ] Yes [ ] No‚Äù.


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Add Link to Privacy Policy

Make your Privacy Policy easily accessible to add transparency and reassure users about how their data will be handled.
 
![smart ways to ask for marketing consent add a link to your privacy policy](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-14-122634-1536x621.png)

**Example**: ‚ÄúBy providing your email address you agree to our [privacy policy](https://www.linktoyourprivacypolicy.com).‚Äù
    
!!! tip "Tip: Link from any text element"
    You can link to your Privacy Policy within any text element of the RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz.


!!! tip "Tip: Marketing Checkmark"
    Follow [these instructions](/how-to-guides/ask-for-marketing-consent/#option-2-marketing-checkmark) to add a marketing checkmark to any quiz slide.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Design Choices Matter

The design and placement of consent requests can significantly impact user engagement.

**Use visual cues** like checkboxes or toggle switches for consent options. You can also use **clickable icons** instead of checkboxes or use buttons that change color or animate when clicked.

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent design choices matter](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent1.gif)

Ensure these options are accessible on all devices with large clickable areas for mobile users. Position consent requests at engaging points in the quiz to avoid disrupting the flow.

!!! tip "Tip: Use Picture Questions"
    Use [Picture Questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-types) to add animated gifs to your quiz choices in RevenueHunt app.

**Example**: ‚ÄúWant to receive our updates? Click the heart to say yes! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù or ‚ÄúWould you like to receive our updates? [ ] Yes, absolutely! (Enthusiastic yes gif) [ ] No, thanks. (Button shakes slightly)‚Äù.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Offer a Clear Opt-Out Option

Respecting user choice is essential. Always provide a clear and **easy way for users to opt-out of marketing communications. Reassure users they can still complete the quiz and receive recommendations even if they choose not to opt-in.

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent offer a clear opt-out option](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent-opt-out-hearts.png)

!!! tip "Tip: Question Description"
    You can add additional information to each quiz slide by activating a [question description](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings) or adding an extra text block in RevenueHunt app.

**Example**: ‚ÄúYou can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in our emails. You can still get your personalized recommendations without signing up for our newsletter.‚Äù

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Reward System

Offer immediate rewards or incentives for giving consent, such as a **discount code** or a free sample.

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent reward system](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent-discount3.png)


!!! tip "Tip: Add Discount"
    Check [this guide](/how-to-guides/add-discount/) to learn how to offer discounts in your RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz.

**Example**: ‚ÄúGet 10% off your next purchase! Do you agree to receive our exclusive offers? [ ] Yes, I love discounts! [ ] No, I‚Äôm good for now.‚Äù

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Build Trust with Transparency

Being transparent about how you will use the data builds trust and increases the likelihood of obtaining consent. Briefly explain why you need the data and how it will benefit the user. Reassure users that **their data will be handled securely** and respectfully.

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent build trust with transparency](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent-discount.png)

**Example**: ‚ÄúWe use your data to provide personalized skincare recommendations and to keep you updated with the latest offers. We respect your privacy and will never share your data with third parties.‚Äù

# Known Bugs & Limitations

We‚Äôre constantly improving the RevenueHunt app. Below you‚Äôll find a list of known bugs (unresolved issues) and current limitations (expected behaviors by design).

## üêû Known Bugs

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

These are the known bugs that we are aware of and are working to fix:
    - **Words/characters index changing while writing (scrambled text)**: Sometimes, while writing on the text inputs of the quiz builder (header, title, text block‚Ä¶) the words or individual characters can ‚Äúlose‚Äù the index continuity and get scrambled.
        !!! note "Status"
            Under investigation.
    - **iPad 10th gen not scrolling properly**: Scrolling is not acting correctly on iPad10th gen (safari) navigation.
        !!! note "Status"
            Under investigation.
    - **Product Quantity Display Issue**: When a product is removed from the cart drawer, the product quantity displayed on the quiz results page is not updated accordingly.
        !!! note "Status"
            Under investigation.
    - **Currency in Analytics always shows in USD**: The currency in analytics always shows in USD.
        !!! note "Status"
            Under investigation.
    - **User Name Display Issue in Email**: Instead of showing the name of the person who completed the quiz, it‚Äôs displaying the question reference like: "Hey Q2: BEFORE WE BEGIN___".
        !!! note "Status"
            Under investigation.
    - **Quiz Completion Behavior**: Closing a pop-up quiz before finishing can cause the website background to turn white, requiring a manual refresh.
        !!! note "Status"
            Likely theme/cart conflict. Under investigation.
    - **Error on Results Page**: In some cases, users encounter an error when responses are saved and they‚Äôre redirected to the results page.
        !!! note "Status"
            Intermittent, under investigation.
    These are not bugs but important to know:
    - **One Klaviyo List per Quiz**: Each quiz can only sync to a single Klaviyo list at a time. For multiple lists, segmentation must be handled inside Klaviyo.
    - **Shopify Markets Integration**: Quizzes can be assigned to different markets, but merchants must configure them manually. Automatic detection per market is not yet supported.
    - **Email Delivery via AWS SES**: Emails are one-off transactional messages triggered by quiz submissions. The app does not support newsletters or recurring campaigns.
    - **Results Precision**: Recommendation accuracy depends on how merchants configure upvotes, logic, and product slots. The app provides flexibility but doesn‚Äôt override merchant settings.

# How to build a Sales Funnel

*(that will convert customers on autopilot)*

The key to any successful eCommerce business is a healthy sales funnel. This is especially true for stores whose survival relies on transforming their site visitors from casual browsers into committed customers.

Over the past few years, eCommerce sales funnels have emerged as one of the fastest ways to get more sales, increase `Average Order Value` and sell more products to every visitor.

![sales funnel](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shopify-sales-funnel-simplified.png)

You‚Äôve probably seen the above visual representation of an eCommerce sales funnel a thousand times. Marketers use them all the time. As you get closer to a sale, the number of people that go to the next step decreases.

!!! info "Main advantages of having a sales funnel are:"

    ‚Äì **Increased sales through better targeting**. Sales funnels advise customers on finding the right products for them and help them make confident purchasing decisions.

    ‚Äì **Getting to know your customers**. During different steps of the funnel, you‚Äôll have the chance to collect actionable data about your customers and define your buyer personas, while considering demographics, customer motivation, behavior patterns, and goals. This information will help you when retargeting customers with segmented marketing campaigns.

    ‚Äì **Building long term relationships with your audience**. Only 2% of shoppers typically convert on their first visit to an eCommerce store. However, with the right incentives, it‚Äôs easy to capture new visitors‚Äô emails. This way you can start building a relationship with them and you can close more sales further down the road.

The process of creating a sales funnel has come a long way, too. Building a sales funnel used to take weeks, require tons of custom coding, and a whole team of developers. These days, **thanks to a few apps**, it‚Äôs now possible to have it **up and running in a few hours**.

A well-built sales funnel can be a powerful foundation to build your eCommerce business on. Unfortunately, the out-of-the-box solution doesn‚Äôt come with many common sales funnel features, like conversion quizzes, one-click upsells, order bumps, and even custom sales pages. However, there are many upsell apps available that help to boost conversion rate and increase revenue with different selling strategies.

!!! note "RevenueHunt"

    [RevenueHunt](https://revenuehunt.com) specializes in building sales funnels for established eCommerce businesses. As a Shopify Partner we focus on working specifically with Shopify stores. We‚Äôre specialists in creating funnels designed both to grow your email list and to drive your sales.

In this article I‚Äôm going to show you how to build a sales funnel that works seamlessly on Shopify to boost conversions for your eCommerce store. I‚Äôll show you exactly which apps to use, how to connect them and I‚Äôll share tips to make sure your funnel pages convert.


## What's an eCommerce Sales Funnel?

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty details of how to build a sales funnel for your eCommerce store, let‚Äôs get on the same page of exactly what a sales funnel is.

A sales funnel takes someone from being a visitor (someone who might have just found your brand through Social Media) and moves them through the buyer‚Äôs journey to become a customer. **It‚Äôs conformed by a number of steps designed to guide shoppers toward a buying decision**.** These steps include marketing assets that actually do the selling for you (eg. quizzes, emails and landing pages).

!!! tip "No sales funnel, no sales"

    Not having a sales funnel and driving paid traffic to your store is like approaching a complete stranger in the street and pitching them a $149 product. No way! 

Now, imagine entering a store and finding a friendly expert staff member who welcomes you and **helps you find exactly what you‚Äôre looking for**. Not only that, but they also share current promotions and sales, discuss complementary items and walk you through the checkout process.

That‚Äôs the effect a well-constructed sales funnel can have on your eCommerce store: **recreating the ‚Äúpersonal shopper‚Äù experience** for your online customers. The goal is to seamlessly guide customers through the entire buying process, from the moment they find out about your brand to buying your products.

!!! example "The Shopify Sales Funnel Template"

    ![sales funnel template](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/shopify-sales-funnel-diagram.png)

    The above diagram is a summary of the blueprint we use to build sales funnels for our Shopify clients. We‚Äôll analyze each step in the funnel and I‚Äôll show you which apps to use in each step.


## Step 1: Turn visitors into Subscribers 

*(with a Conversion Quiz)*

Our main goal in this step is to **get your visitors‚Äô email before we send them to our first sales funnel**. It‚Äôs of great importance to get this first step right because the effectiveness of the rest of the steps will depend on it.

The easiest way to do this is with a conversion quiz created with the RevenueHunt app.

Not only will you offer your customers a personalized product recommendation, you‚Äôll also be able to **segment your customers based on their responses to the quiz**. It‚Äôs growing your email list on steroids. Apart from their contact details you‚Äôll gather important actionable data about your customers‚Äô preferences which you can use for higher ROI retargeting campaigns further down the funnel.

A product recommendation quiz is a fun way to engage your customers by offering them the chance to learn something about themselves. For example, if you‚Äôre selling coffee, a quiz can help your customers discover their ‚Äúcoffee personality‚Äù while they learn new facts about different types of coffee and **recommending products that are tailored to their preferences**.

Just **make sure you get their email**! You can do this by offering them an ethical bribe at the end of the quiz like ‚Äúget your results directly in your inbox and receive a 10% discount coupon for your next purchase‚Äù.

With Product Recommendation Quiz, you can use one of the pre-defined quiz templates and modify it (highly recommended) or create a new quiz from scratch.

## Step 2: Draw Subscribers Back to Your Funnel

Ideally, after taking the conversion quiz, your visitors will **proceed to your first Free+Shipping & Upsell funnel (Step 3)**. But this won‚Äôt always be the case.

You‚Äôll have to **draw visitors that dropped out back to your sales funnel**.

Remember that in the previous step we used a quiz to segment your customers? In this step you‚Äôll use that data to **send targeted drip email campaigns to segmented lists** that lead subscribers into sales funnels of free+shipping offers and higher-priced product upsells.

You‚Äôll use 2 tools for this: [Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/) and [Meta Pixel](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/).

### Klaviyo

First, [connect your quiz to Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/) to send captured leads to your email marketing list.

!!! info "Connect your quiz to Klaviyo"

    Check this article to learn how to connect your quiz to Klaviyo: [How to Send Quiz Leads to Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/)

The typical **Klaviyo retargeting campaign** consists of a drip flow of 4 emails. The first email is sent immediately and includes the products that have been recommended during the quiz along with a discount code. It also includes a link to a particular Free+Shipping & Upsells funnel. The rest of the emails deliver content which is targeted to that particular client and also link to the same funnel.

**The first email usually brings in 45% of the sales**, the second accounts for 30%, the third accounts for 15% and the fourth usually leads to the final 10% of revenue. These stats show that the first email in any drip campaign is always the most important in terms of engagement. It also highlights the importance of having a drip sequence which follows up.

It is of great importance to create dynamic segments based on your customers‚Äô responses and send each segment different, hyper-targeted campaigns (which return more than [3X the revenue per recipient](https://www.klaviyo.com/marketing-resources/segmentation-benchmark-report) as unsegmented campaigns ‚Äì more on this later).

With Klaviyo you can [create segments](/how-to-guides/create-segments-in-klaviyo/) to filter your leads and assign email flows to each segment.

### Meta Pixel

A complementary tool we‚Äôll use is the [Meta Pixel](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/). It‚Äôs an analytics tool that allows you to measure the effectiveness of your advertising by understanding the actions people take on your quiz.

It collects data that helps you track conversions from Facebook ads, optimize ads, build targeted audiences for future ads (lookalike audiences), and remarket to people who have already taken some kind of action on your website (retargeting).

!!! info "Set up a Meta Pixel"

    If you don‚Äôt have one already, follow [these instructions](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/#setting-up-your-meta-pixel) to create a new Pixel on Facebook and connect it to your quiz. 


In our case, we‚Äôll **use the Pixel to create 2 audiences**: 

1. People who have visited the website but still haven‚Äôt taken the conversion quiz
2. People who have taken the conversion quiz

!!! tip

    Check Meta documentation to learn how to create audiences: [How to Create Audiences with Meta Pixel](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/164749007013531?id=401668390442328)

Now we‚Äôll create 2 ads campaigns (on Facebook, Instagram or both, depending on your sector). We‚Äôll use them to **drive the first audience to the conversion quiz** (to capture their emails) and the **second audience to our Free+Shipping & Upsells funnels**.

We‚Äôll have several Free+Shipping & Upsells funnels in place, one for each customer type in order to maximize our ROI with hyper-segmentation.

!!! example "Hair care business"

    Let‚Äôs say you sell hair care products. You could use the conversion quiz to segment your customers into four categories:

    - Customers with straight hair
    - Customers with wavy hair
    - Customers with curly hair
    - Customers with coily hair

    Then you would create **4 different Free+Shipping & Upsells funnels**, one for each category, and different email drip campaigns drawing customers back to each of the funnels.


## Step 3: Create a Free+Shipping & Upsells funnel

The goals of this funnel are two:

- To separate lookie-loos (no intention of buying) from shoppers
- To make shoppers take action and start buying

We do this with a Free+Shipping offer: **people are inherently attracted to getting stuff for free**, even if they have to pay for the shipping to get it. Now once they‚Äôve pulled out their card and are willing to pay for something (even if it‚Äôs only the shipping costs) they‚Äôve already taken the first step and it‚Äôs much easier to pitch them upsells.

We show customers **one-time offers where they can get higher price items at discounted rates‚Ä¶ but only if they act NOW**. If they accept the offer, you don‚Äôt stop there. You pitch them another upsell. Why stop at one if they‚Äôre on a shopping run? If they don‚Äôt accept any of your upsells, you show them a downsell (a lower price product).

After your clients have gone through the upsells and downsells, they‚Äôre taken to the checkout page.

!!! example "Sample Funnel"

    Here‚Äôs an example of what a sales funnel would look like: [Skincare Quiz](https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/#quiz-wnHLkP)


I‚Äôm sure you can **find ideas of stuff you can give away for free**. Example: a cosmetics store can send free samples of creams and only charge for the shipping.

You can use the RevenueHunt app to create this funnel, just use one of our avialble quiz templates and adapt it to your store. This quiz‚Äôs logic is already pre-built to guide your customers through the different offers. You‚Äôll have to edit the texts, change the images and adjust the quiz‚Äôs design to match your store‚Äôs look & feel.


## Step 4: Optimize your Order Confirmation

Check out this sample Amazon thank you page:

!!! example "Amazon's thank you page"

    ![Amazon's thank you page](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/amazon-thank-you-page.png)

These guys know what they‚Äôre doing: they‚Äôre **cross-selling products even after the customer has completed the purchase**.

Your store‚Äôs order confirmation page (or ‚Äúthank you‚Äù page) gives you the perfect cross-sell opportunity. Also, customers visit the order status page more than once ‚Äì when receiving default notifications from your store (like shipping updates) via email or SMS.

By optimizing your thank you page and adding upsells or cross-sells, you will re-engage customers who just completed a purchase with your store and **catch them when they are most likely to buy**.

## Step 5: Convert Buyers into Repetitive Buyers

Here‚Äôs a metric you should be familiar with: `Repeat Customer Rate` (or `Repeat Purchase Rate`).

Repeat customer rate is the backbone of customer retention. It measures the percentage of customers **willing to make a second purchase from you**. Measuring your repeat purchase rate is an excellent way of evaluating how well your retention strategy is actually working. The higher this metric is, the more willing customers are to return to your store.

Fortunately, this is calculated for you in your [Shopify Analytics](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/reports-and-analytics/shopify-reports). If you want to do this manually, all you need to do is divide the number of customers with more than one purchase by the number of unique customers.

![repeat rate calculation](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/repeat-rate.png)

A repeat purchase is an indicator of a degree of customer loyalty to a brand. It is also an opportunity to establish long-term customer relationships. A high number of repeat purchases indicates a satisfied and ‚Äúwell-retained‚Äù customer. This reduces new-customer acquisition costs and increases overall profitability.

The big question is‚Ä¶ how can you increase this number?

The business‚Äô repeat purchase rate may be increased using promotions, loyalty programs and exceptional customer service. In summary: **following up with your customers**.

But with average open rates of email campaigns being at only 21.3%, you‚Äôll have to make sure you don‚Äôt end up in your customer‚Äôs spam folder. The solution to this is **sending the right message to the right customer at the right time** ‚Äì also known as hyper-segmentation.

[Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/) is an excellent tool for following up both via email and SMS. Combined with Product Recommendation Quiz it will take your follow-up campaigns to the next level. With Product Recommendation Quiz you‚Äôll be able to tag your customers based on their responses and you can create segments in Klaviyo based on these tags.

Unlike traditional subscriber lists, **segments are groupings of contacts defined by a set of conditions**. Lists are static, meaning they grow as people subscribe or are manually added. Segments, on the other hand, are dynamic. They grow as people meet the segments‚Äô conditions and shrink as people no longer meet them.

!!! example "How you can use segments to identify different audiences:"

    - Using a Product Recommendation Quiz to categorize customers based on their product preferences
    - Customers who purchase a new product, so you can watch the segment grow after launch
    - Inactive subscribers who have been on your list for at least 6 months but have never opened or clicked an email
    - Repeat customers, which includes everyone who has purchased at least X number of times before or have spent over Y amount of money


The bottom line here is that highly segmented campaigns return more than 3X the revenue per recipient as unsegmented campaigns thanks to higher open rates and click-through rates.


## Step 6: Turn Happy Customers into Brand Ambassadors

In today‚Äôs eCommerce industry, it‚Äôs not enough to offer the best products or the cheapest deals. Driving traffic to your Shopify store is only half the battle. If you don‚Äôt get your customers to buy, it‚Äôs wasted money in ads. So how do we persuade your visitors into buying?

There are multiple elements that are factored into a visitor‚Äôs motivation to take action and buy. We‚Äôre going to focus on one of the most important: **social proof**. 

Social proof is a **powerful psychological bias that causes us to copy others**. For example, when we are unsure what to do, we often imitate the people around us. People are persuaded more by the actions of others than by any argument we can give them.

Two ways to create social proof in your Shopify store are **customer reviews and user generated content**. Happy customers leave positive reviews, but here‚Äôs the catch: you‚Äôll have to ask them to leave one!

When asking for reviews, there are two factors you have to take into account:

- WHEN you ask
- HOW you ask


### WHEN to ask for reviews

In many cases, asking for a review request immediately after the purchase just doesn‚Äôt make sense. Normally, we say the ideal time to ask for a review is when you can be sure the buyer journey is over. The product will not only have arrived, but the customer will also have had a decent chance to use it.

This way, they can leave a review that‚Äôs really insightful and of high quality, covering everything from the on-site experience to delivery speed and quality of the item received.

We recommend sending a review request when the entire buyer journey has been completed ‚Äì this could be anywhere from 7 to 30 days depending on the product type and the delivery time.


### HOW to ask for reviews

Our experience is that the best way to do this is to first ask for feedback and later ask for a review. This way, you make sure that if there were any issues during the buyer journey you can address them before they leave a negative review.

Consider using a review app to automate the process of sending review requests. This takes away the stress of sending review requests, which would otherwise be a process you have to do manually. 

## Step 7: Measure, Analyze, Improve and Repeat

An important mistake many store owners make is to consider that the sales cycle ends when a purchase is completed. Nothing could be further from the truth. After a customer has bought a product there are still many cross-sell and upsell opportunities.

Getting existing customers to buy other products from you is much easier (and cheaper) than acquiring new customers. It‚Äôs much **more ROI efficient to maintain and grow an existing relationship** with a validated customer than starting from square one with a new visitor.

Additionally, we always recommend merchants to consider **collecting reviews and user-generated content from their customers as part of their sales cycle**. These reviews or ‚Äúcustomer success stories‚Äù can be used as social proof in other steps of the funnel and in your store.

It‚Äôs inevitable to experience some drop-off as customers move down the sales funnel. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to **measure conversion rates at each step**, so you can monitor and analyze these metrics and run A/B tests. You can use Google Analytics to monitor your funnel‚Äôs performance.

Every step of the funnel can be A/B tested and improved. 

!!! example "A few A/B tests that you can run are:"

    - Step 1: different CTAs to draw site traffic to your quiz
    - Step 2: different quiz lengths (benchmark: dropdown increases significantly past the 6th question)
    - Step 3: different ad copy
    - Step 4: different offers, upsells & downsells
    - Step 5: different confirmation page setups
    - Step 6: different email drips (email subject, content, frequency‚Ä¶)

Since you‚Äôll be measuring rates (percentage of customers that go from one step to the next) you can **run more than one A/B test at a time**.

---

eCommerce sales funnels are an easy and profitable upgrade for established stores with existing traffic. They can return the initial investment within just a few weeks.

Ecommerce stores should be using the power of sales funnels to turn cold traffic into subscribers and then into customers.

Sales funnels increase the average order value per visitor. This allows store owners to invest more on ads for their profitable funnels.

This article explains how to build a sales funnel for your eCommerce store.

# How to Convert Leads to Customers

A product recommendation quiz is more than just an engagement tool. Done right, it becomes the foundation of your **customer acquisition and retention strategy**. By capturing contact details and delivering personalized results, you can build trust, drive conversions, and turn first-time quiz takers into long-term buyers.

---

## Why Lead Conversion Matters

Every completed quiz gives you two things:

* **Zero-party data** ‚Äî insights customers willingly share (skin type, age, goals, preferences).
* **Buying intent** ‚Äî customers are already engaged and closer to purchase than cold leads.

Instead of letting this data sit idle, you should use it to **personalize follow-ups**. Sending the right product recommendations to the right person at the right time can dramatically increase sales.

---

## Send Result Emails Directly from the App

The simplest way to convert quiz takers is to **send results instantly**. With the üíéBuilt for Shopify RevenueHunt app, you can email quiz results without needing a third-party tool.

Why this works:

* Customers expect instant results after investing time in a quiz.
* Seeing personalized recommendations in their inbox builds credibility and encourages immediate action.
* You don‚Äôt need to set up external tools if you want a quick, lightweight funnel.

How to do it:

1. Add an **Email Address question block** to your quiz.
2. Go to **Quiz Settings ‚Üí Emails ‚Üí Respondents**.
3. Enable **Send Results Email** and customize the email template.
4. Personalize it with dynamic content such as product images, titles, and prices.

üëâ [Learn how to send result emails](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/)

---

## Connect Your Quiz to a CRM or Marketing Platform

For advanced flows, connect your quiz to your CRM or ESP (Email Service Provider). The app integrates with tools like **Klaviyo, Omnisend, Mailchimp, HubSpot, and Zapier**.

Why this matters:

* You can build **multi-step post-quiz email flows**.
* Quiz answers and recommended products are synced as custom properties in your CRM.
* You can segment your audience (e.g., ‚Äúdry skin + prefers vegan products‚Äù) and target them with tailored campaigns.

Best Practices for Follow-Up Email Flows

Sending results is just the first step. To maximize conversions, follow up with a structured email flow that builds trust and encourages repeat purchases.

Recommended flow for quiz-takers:

- **Results Email** (Immediately): Send the quiz results with recommended products and a clear ‚ÄúShop Now‚Äù CTA.

- **Education Email** (1‚Äì2 days later): Provide usage tips, routines, or benefits of the recommended products.

- **Social Proof Email** (3‚Äì5 days later): Share testimonials, before/after photos, or customer stories.

- **Incentive Email** (5‚Äì7 days later): Offer a discount, free gift, or bundle deal to drive the purchase.

- **Retention Email** (2‚Äì3 weeks later): Recommend refills, complementary products, or subscription options.

This sequence works especially well in the beauty and supplements industries, where customer trust and education play a big role in buying decisions.

Example flow in Klaviyo:

1. **Immediately** ‚Äì Send results with product images and ‚ÄúShop Now‚Äù CTA.
2. **1‚Äì2 days later** ‚Äì Send an educational email with tips for their skin/hair type.
3. **3‚Äì5 days later** ‚Äì Share testimonials or success stories.
4. **5‚Äì7 days later** ‚Äì Offer a discount code or bundle deal.
5. **2‚Äì3 weeks later** ‚Äì Retarget with refills or complementary products.

üëâ [See all integrations](/how-to-guides/integrations/)

---

## Other Tips for Converting Leads

* **Make the email optional**: Some customers prefer immediate results without sharing details. This keeps the experience frictionless while still capturing quality leads from engaged users.
* **Offer incentives**: Reward customers for completing the quiz with a discount or free gift. This boosts both lead capture and conversions.
* **Use personalization**: Address the customer by name and recall their quiz answers in follow-ups. This makes your messages feel like expert advice, not generic marketing.
* **Track performance**: Monitor open rates, click-through rates, and conversions in your ESP to refine your post-quiz funnel.

---

‚úÖ By combining instant result emails with a CRM-powered follow-up flow, you‚Äôll transform your quiz into a **conversion engine** that nurtures leads into loyal customers.

# How to Build a Successful Product Recommendation Quiz

Building a product selector for your eCommerce store has never been easier with our completely new `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app. 

!!! info "üíéBuilt for Shopify RevenueHunt app"

    The `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app is a new version of the app that went through a complete re-design.

    With our modern drag-and-drop builder, extensive design options, and powerful recommendation engine, you can create stunning quizzes that perfectly match your brand. We offer a variety of design and content [templates](https://revenuehunt.com/templates/) tailored specially for the beauty industry (skin care quiz, hair care quiz, lipstick match finder) and other verticals.

While creating a quiz is straightforward, ensuring it serves both your audience and your business requires some strategic thinking. At RevenueHunt, **we've analyzed countless successful product recommendation quizzes** and built our new Shopify app based on what works best. We've identified elements that make quizzes popular with online shoppers and drive results for brands.

In this article, we've gathered all this knowledge to help you build a high-converting product selector that uses the latest features of our platform.

<div class="videoWrapper">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJaiwjhyNgI?si=3XG85TzxvvXtsTw0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Here‚Äôs a list of things every Product Recommendation Quiz should have (and how to add them):

## 1. Make the quiz visible

*(publish on the header, publish in multiple locations)*

You can have the most beautiful and thought-through quiz in the world but it won't be useful if your customers cannot find it. Just like a real-life shop attendant, the quiz should reach out to the customers to ask *"Is there anything I can help you with?"*. 

Our new  `üíéBuilt for Shopify` RevenueHunt app offers native integration with your store, making it easier than ever to [publish your quiz](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz/). Unlike the legacy version that used iframes, the new version embeds directly into your store's theme for better performance and seamless integration. 

!!! info "You can:"

    - Add the quiz as a native Shopify block anywhere on your pages
    - Create a floating chat-like button that follows customers as they browse
    - Set up automatic popups for new visitors
    - Embed the quiz inline with your content
    - Add quiz links to your navigation menu

Most successful quizzes are **published in multiple locations** to help customers at different stages of their shopping journey. 

!!! example "You can publish your quiz in multiple locations:"

    - A native quiz block in your homepage header showcases the quiz as a key feature
    - A floating button provides easy access as customers browse your collections
    - An automatic popup engages first-time visitors
    - Inline quizzes within relevant collection pages help customers make informed choices (e.g., a shade finder quiz in your lipstick collection)

![how to build a succesful quiz image1](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image1.png)

Ensuring that the quiz is easy to find can make a big difference in your sales conversions. Most quiz takers try the quiz a few times before completing the purchase. Make the quiz visible and you‚Äôll see the sales go up!

## 2. Match the store‚Äôs design

*(Design: match stores font and color scheme, use a background image, CSS)*

You know this already. A beautifully designed website sells better than a generic one and so does the quiz! Our new  `üíéBuilt for Shopify` app takes quiz design to the next level with a powerful visual design system.

!!! info "Quiz Design Options"

    The new [Quiz Design](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/) interface features a Shopify-like Block Editor that makes customization intuitive and powerful:

    - **Visual Block Editor**: Add, reorder, and customize blocks for questions, results, product slots, and HTML content with simple drag-and-drop
    - **Typography & Colors**: Fine-tune your fonts, colors, and button styles to match your brand perfectly
    - **Modern Templates**: Choose from our collection of professionally designed templates built specifically for Shopify
    - **Layout Control**: Adjust spacing, alignment, and layout without touching code
    - **Custom CSS/JS**: For advanced users, you still have full control through custom code

The native integration with Shopify means your quiz will inherit some of your theme's styles automatically (like your website's font), creating a matching experience. You can then customize further to make it uniquely yours. Check out these beautiful [customization examples](https://revenuehunt.com/templates/#customization) to gather inspiration for your next quiz project!

![how to build a succesful quiz image2](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image2.png)

## 3. Come up with a professional name for the quiz

*(Eg. ‚ÄúShade Finder‚Äù, ‚ÄúPersonalized Skin Prescription‚Äù, ‚ÄúRoutine Builder‚Äù, ‚ÄúSkin Test‚Äù)*

Let‚Äôs talk names now. When you hear the word ‚Äòquiz‚Äô, what is the first thing that comes to mind? To most people a quiz is either a dreadful school memory or a lighthearted ‚ÄòWhich animal are you?‚Äô entertainment. The truth is, the word quiz doesn‚Äôt have the best reputation, but fortunately you don‚Äôt have to stick with it. 

Finding the right name for your quiz can sometimes be key to getting more conversions. A **‚ÄòShade finder‚Äô**, a **‚ÄòSkincare Routine builder‚Äô**, **‚ÄòSkin Diagnostic‚Äô**, **‚ÄòHair Analysis‚Äô** sound more like a professional questionnaire than entertainment, don‚Äôt they? The secret is in the name, so try to find something that fits your brand well and provides value for the customer. If you‚Äôre not sure what to choose, think about your customer‚Äôs most asked questions and start there.

![how to build a succesful quiz image3](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image3.jpg)

## 4. Add personalized advice

*(Jump logic, Skip logic, Display logic)*

One way to make the quiz more than just a product selector is to add personalized advice based on customer answers. Our new `üíéBuilt for Shopify` app makes this easier than ever with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for conditional logic.

!!! info "Conditional Logic"

    The new visual [Conditional Logic](/how-to-guides/hide-content-with-logic/) builder lets you create complex personalization flows without any coding:

    - Design complex branching paths with an intuitive interface similar to Shopify's theme editor with our visual logic builder
    - Chose from multiple logic types:

        - **Jump Logic**: Send customers to different questions based on their answers
        - **Skip Logic**: Hide irrelevant questions automatically
        - **Display Logic**: Show/hide content blocks based on previous answers
        - **Score Logic**: Track points and create personality-based recommendations


!!! example "When can I use logic?"

    - Does your customer have dry skin? Use Jump Logic to direct them to specific questions about dry skin concerns, completely skipping the oily skin path

    - Your customer suffers from hair loss? Create a branching path with Jump Logic that explores different causes (medication, genetic conditions, lifestyle) and provides tailored product recommendations and advice

    - Want to show special content to premium customers? Use Display Logic to reveal exclusive offers based on their responses

The visual logic builder makes it easy to create an experience that feels like talking to a real expert, guiding customers to the perfect products for their needs.

![how to build a succesful quiz image4](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic.png)

The same logic can also be applied to the contents of the Results Page. A different content block can be shown to customers with dry skin and oily skin. A different advice can be given to customers with colored or natural hair. 

![how to build a succesful quiz image4](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_answers_example1.png)

The Results Page is also a great place to give additional ‚Äúhow to use‚Äù advice or even add a prediction on how their skin will improve in the months/weeks of using the product (all depending on the customer's skin type).

## 5. Use descriptive pictures to help customers decide

*(Design your own icons & add picture questions)*

It is not always easy to know whether you have dry or oily skin, whether your complexion is light or dark, what exactly your hair-color is called‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs no better way to help the customer choose than by showing them an example. 

Adding a **[Picture question](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-types)** to your Product Recommendation Quiz can be a great way to help the customer pick the right answer and help them make an educated purchasing decision. You can add real-life examples for your customers to relate to or design your own beautiful icons that will match your store‚Äôs style. A visual quiz gets more completions than a fully-text-based one, so make sure to include some images!

![how to build a succesful quiz image5](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image5.jpg)

![how to build a succesful quiz image6](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image6.jpg)

## 6. Keep it short

*(Max. 5-6 questions)*

This is probably the most important piece of advice on this list. No matter what you do, if your Product Recommendation Quiz is too long, you‚Äôll not see the desired effects. 

Our research shows that most successful quizzes have **max. 5-6 questions**. In other cases, customers typically drop out after question 8 and almost nobody gets to question 12. There‚Äôs power in simplicity! Even if your quiz has some branching, make sure that the total time they spent on the quiz is less than 1-2 minutes.

## 7. Limit the recommended products

*(1-2, or 1 for each type)*

The less choice we have, the less time we spend deciding and the higher the chance we'll buy. Our new `üíéBuilt for Shopify` app gives you powerful tools to create focused, personalized recommendations.

!!! info "Flexible Recommendation System"

    - **Dynamic Recommendations**: Products are recommended based on customer responses, using our intelligent voting system
    - **Fixed Recommendations**: Manually choose specific products for certain answer combinations
    - **Collection Recommendations**: Recommend entire collections instead of individual products - perfect for bundles, seasonal lines, or product types
    - **Recommendation Slots**: Create structured routines by assigning products to specific slots (e.g., cleanser, toner, moisturizer)

Best Practices:

- For simple products: Recommend 1-2 best-matching items
- For routines: Use slots to recommend one product per category
- For collections: Show a curated collection that matches their needs
- Use fixed recommendations for your best-sellers or when you want complete control

The key is to make the choice clear and focused. What's the point of a quiz if you end up with 10 results from which you still need to choose? Keep it simple and watch your conversion rates grow.

![how to build a succesful quiz image7](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image7.png)

## 8. Make it Personalized

*(Recall names & answers)*

Want to make the shopping experience ultra personal? RevenueHunt app lets you use the information provided by the customer and add it to various parts of the quiz. You can, for example, ask for a person‚Äôs name and recall the answer in the next question, on the Results Page or even in the follow-up email. [Information Recalls or Content Dynamic Source](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) are a powerful tool which makes your quiz look professional, while actually being very simple to implement. 

Take a look at this example of a haircare quiz:

![how to build a succesful quiz image8](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image8.gif)

## 9. Send results to the customer if they want

*(Email, Klaviyo, Omnisend, Mailchimp...)*

A well-structured sales funnel, with a Product Recommendation Quiz and a targeted email campaign, can lead to 50% higher conversions. A quiz can serve as an excellent lead collector. Not only are you able to get email addresses or phone numbers via the quiz, but you can also segment your audience based on their quiz answers and follow up with an email tailored to their needs. 

Think about a marketing campaign focused on people living in large urban areas, where a proper morning or evening skin routine is especially important for a clear complexion. Big brands know that a swift follow-up is crucial to maintaining the customer‚Äôs attention. 

With RevenueHunt app, you‚Äôre able to [send quiz results](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/) directly to the customer seconds after completing the quiz. You can even connect your quiz to [Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/) and send the customer a full list of results including product pictures, descriptions, discount codes or instructions for use.

While collecting emails is a very important part of a sales, some customers prefer to take time before trusting your brand with this information. Some customers will leave immediately and some just want to see the results. To ensure the quality of the leads generated by the quiz the RevenueHunt app allows you to **make the email question optional** or even give a customer a choice if they want to see it or not.

## 10. Offer a discount after completing

*(Automatic discounts)*

This one is simple but effective! You want to reward your customers for taking a minute of their time to fill in all this valuable information (for your business). Adding a [discount code](/how-to-guides/add-discount/) at the end of the quiz can be a great way to encourage shoppers to finish the purchase. RevenueHunt app syncs the discount codes you‚Äôve set up in your store and can apply them automatically to every shopping cart.

You can even add a special code to be used at checkout for the people who answer a specific question. For example, a special discount for customers who want both,a day and night routine, to be recommended.

![how to build a succesful quiz image9](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image9.gif)

## 11. Go Global with Shopify Markets

*(Multi-language and multi-currency support)*

Our `üíéBuilt for Shopify` app now fully integrates with Shopify Markets, making it easy to serve customers worldwide with localized experiences:

- **Multiple Languages**: Create separate quiz versions for different languages
- **Automatic Market Detection**: Show the right quiz version based on visitor location
- **Currency Adaptation**: Display prices in local currencies automatically
- **Market-Specific Content**: Customize product recommendations and advice for different regions
- **Seamless Integration**: Works naturally with your Shopify Markets configuration

!!! tip "Best Practices"

    - Create separate quizzes for your main market languages
    - Use market-specific product recommendations when needed
    - Keep quiz logic consistent across versions
    - Test your quiz in different markets to ensure a smooth experience

This powerful integration helps you create a truly global shopping experience while maintaining the personal touch that makes quizzes so effective.

## Plans & Pricing Details

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

- We recently transitioned to a **usage-based pricing model**. All of our plans include all the features, including the Free Plan.
    - Every day, our billing system calculates the responses captured during the **past 30 days (rolling)**. Your plan is based on usage in retrospect.
    - If your quizzes receive more responses than your plan allows in the past 30 days, the app will prompt you to **upgrade to a higher plan**. Conversely, if your usage decreases, you can **downgrade to a lower plan**.
    - We offer **flexible upgrades** and charge only for the proportional days you've been on each plan each month.
    - If you need to **temporarily upgrade for a marketing campaign**, you can downgrade later if your usage decreases.
    - There's no limit to the number of quizzes you can create, even on the Free plan. Our pricing is purely based on quiz usage.
    | Plan name  | Monthly fee      | Max. responses   | Cost per response |
    |------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
    | Free       | $0 USD/mo.       | 100 /30 days     | Free              |
    | Basic      | $39 USD/mo.      | 500 /30 days     | $0.078 USD        |
    | Pro        | $99 USD/mo.      | 1,000 /30 days   | $0.099 USD        |
    | Premium    | $199 USD/mo.     | 2,500 /30 days   | $0.080 USD        |
    | Unlimited  | $299 USD/mo.     | Unlimited        | -                 |
    If you need to upgrade temporarily for a marketing campaign, you can downgrade later on to a smaller plan if your usage is lower. You can easily do it yourself from the [App Settings > Plans & Pricing](/reference/plans-pricing/) page in the app.
    Bear in mind that if you need to upgrade/downgrade we‚Äôre very flexible. When changing plans Shopify will automatically discount the proportional part of the monthly plan that hasn‚Äôt been used.
    Billing is handled directly by Shopify. Charges for the app will be visible on your monthly invoice from Shopify. You can change your billing details directly in your Shopify store settings.
    If you have any other questions about billing or refunds, please [contact support](/how-to-guides/contact-customer-support/).
    We will notify you in your Dashboard, when you reach 90%, 100% and 125% of your plan's limit.
    When you reach 125% of your plan‚Äôs response limit, your quizzes will be locked. Your quizzes will automatically be unlocked again when the number of quiz responses collected during the past 30 days is lower than your plan‚Äôs limit.
    You can delete your responses, but this won‚Äôt affect your monthly quiz usage.
    When you reach your quiz responses limit, your users will see a message like the one below when they try to take your quiz: `This quiz isn‚Äôt accepting new responses`.
    If you‚Äôve just installed the RevenueHunt app, it is advised to stay on a monthly plan for some time to check your quiz usage. 
    Once you‚Äôre sure of what your stable usage is in a month, you can choose to pay for a yearly plan upfront with a reduced monthly rate. To buy a yearly plan, navigate to the [Plans & Pricing tab](/reference/plans-pricing/) in the app and select the `Billing Period` to `Annualy`.

# Why Your Product Quiz is NOT Converting Well

Product quizzes are a great way to personalize shopping experiences and boost sales, but sometimes they just don‚Äôt hit the mark. If your quiz isn‚Äôt converting as well as you‚Äôd like, you‚Äôre not alone.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jmjHlwEErI?si=a5bEg-I7CrPHPj7T" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

Here are some common reasons why your quiz is not working well and how you can fix it.

## üéØ  You Don‚Äôt Have Clear Goals

If you don‚Äôt know what you want your quiz to achieve, it‚Äôs hard to make it effective. Are you trying to *increase sales*, *gather customer data*, or just *engage your audience*?

Without a clear purpose, your quiz might miss the mark.

**Solution**

Decide what you want your quiz to do. For instance, if you want to boost sales, make sure your questions help guide users to only the products you know they‚Äôll love. Keep track of metrics that show you‚Äôre reaching your goals, like conversion rates and average order value.


| Goal | Solution |
|------|-----------|
| **Increasing Sales** | ‚Ä¢ `Define Sales Objectives`: Set specific targets, like increasing average order value or boosting conversion rates by X%.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Tailored Product Recommendations`: Ensure your quiz directs users to products they are more likely to buy based on their answers and that you don't show too many products on your results page (recommending 1 product that matches all customer criteria is best). |
| **Gathering Customer Data** | ‚Ä¢ `Focus on Insights`: Design questions that help you understand your customers' preferences and behaviors.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Data Collection`: Use the quiz to gather valuable information like email addresses, preferences, and pain points. You can easily [download all the quiz responses](/how-to-guides/download-quiz-responses/) or [connect your quiz to GA4](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) for advanced behavioral analytics. |
| **Engaging Your Audience** | ‚Ä¢ `Interactive Elements`: Include engaging and fun elements like images, videos, and gamified components. Visual quizzes maintain the customer's attention.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Entertainment and Informative Value`: Make sure the quiz is enjoyable and informative, keeping the audience interested but also feeling like they are learning something. |

!!! tip "Tip: Check Metrics"

    Check the [Quiz Metrics & Analytics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/) section for insights on your quiz engagement and sales.

    Our latest article explains which quiz metrics are important and how to improve them: [Product Quiz Metrics: What to Track to Convert Better](/customer-success/track-quiz-metrics-for-better-conversions/)


## ü•± Your Questions Are Boring

If your quiz is boring, users won‚Äôt stick around to finish it. A dull design, lack of interactivity, and uninspiring content can all lead to low engagement.

Long, complex, or irrelevant questions can also drive users away. If your questions are too generic, they won‚Äôt provide a personalized experience.

**Solution**

Make your quiz visually appealing and interactive. Use images, videos, and animations to keep it interesting. Add elements like progress bars and instant feedback to make the experience more fun.

![visually appealing and interactive quiz](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-10-090342-e1720595102774.png)

Keep your questions short, sweet, and to the point. Make sure they‚Äôre relevant to what your customers care about. Use simple language and avoid jargon. Every question should help you understand your customers better or steer them toward the right product.

| Goal | Solution |
|------|-----------|
| **Increasing Sales** | ‚Ä¢ `Interactive Elements`: Use interactive questions and features to keep users interested.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Relevant Questions, Direct Path to Purchase`: Ask only questions that help narrow down the best products for the user. Ensure questions are geared towards identifying products that fit the user's needs.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Product Highlights`: Showcase product benefits and unique selling points throughout the product description in the quiz. |
| **Gathering Customer Data** | ‚Ä¢ `Fun Questions`: Make data-gathering questions fun and engaging.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Rewards for Participation`: Offer incentives for completing the quiz, like [discounts](/how-to-guides/add-discount/) or entries into a giveaway.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Insightful Queries`: Include questions that provide deeper insights into customer preferences and demographics.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Progressive Profiling`: Gradually gather more detailed information with each quiz interaction. |
| **Engaging Your Audience** | ‚Ä¢ `Entertaining Questions`: Use questions that are fun and engaging, such as personality-based or lifestyle questions.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Gamification`: Incorporate elements of gamification, such as progress bars and badges.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Visual Appeal`: Incorporate images and videos to make questions more interesting.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Storytelling`: Use a narrative approach to make the quiz more engaging. |

!!! tip "Tip: Use Picture Questions"

    Use [Picture Questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) to add images or animated gifs to your quiz choices in the RevenueHunt quiz app.

!!! tip "Tip: Upload Images and Videos"

    You can upload [images and videos](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/#adding-images-and-videos) to any quiz question in the RevenueHunt quiz app.


## ü§î Your Results Are Too Generic

If you recommend too many products to the customer, they still will not know what to put in their cart. Recommending too many products ads an extra decision step in the customer‚Äôs shopping journey.

If your quiz results aren‚Äôt personalized, users will feel like they wasted their time. Generic results won‚Äôt make users excited about your products.

**Solution**

Recommend a single product that matches all the customer criteria or a full routine with one product per step. This way the customer will know what to add to cart right away and it will significantly increase your conversion rate.

![single product recommendation](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-10-090001.png)

Use the data from the quiz to give personalized recommendations. Make sure the results are specific to each user‚Äôs answers. Highlight why these products are perfect for them.

| Goal | Solution |
|------|-----------|
| **Increasing Sales** | ‚Ä¢ `Personalized Recommendations`: Provide highly tailored product suggestions based on quiz answers.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Highlight Benefits`: Clearly explain why each recommended product is a great fit for the user. |
| **Gathering Customer Data** | ‚Ä¢ `Detailed Insights`: Offer results that give users a deep understanding of their preferences and needs.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Encourage Profile Completion`: Use results to prompt users to complete their profiles for even more personalized recommendations. |
| **Engaging Your Audience** | ‚Ä¢ `Interactive Results`: Make the results page interactive, with clickable elements that lead to more content or products.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Shareable Outcomes`: Create results that are fun to share on social media, increasing engagement. |


!!! tip 

    Check here how to customize your Results Page for better conversions: [How to Customize Your Results Page](/how-to-guides/edit-results-page/)


## üì¢ Weak Calls to Action (CTAs)

If your CTAs aren‚Äôt clear or strong, users might not know what to do next. This can lead to missed conversions.

**Solution**

Make your CTAs clear and direct. Whether it‚Äôs ‚ÄúShop Now,‚Äù ‚ÄúLearn More,‚Äù or ‚ÄúGet Your Results,‚Äù make sure users know what to do next. Experiment with different texts and placements to see what works best.



| Goal | Solution |
|------|-----------|
| **Increasing Sales** | ‚Ä¢ `Strong CTAs`: Use clear and compelling CTAs like "Shop Now" or "Buy Now."<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Prominent Placement`: Ensure CTAs are prominently placed and easy to find. |
| **Gathering Customer Data** | ‚Ä¢ `Data-Driven CTAs`: Encourage users to provide more information with CTAs like "Tell Us More" or "Complete Your Profile."<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Lead Magnets`: Offer incentives for sharing data, such as [discounts](/how-to-guides/add-discount/) or free samples. |
| **Engaging Your Audience** | ‚Ä¢ `Engagement CTAs`: Use CTAs that encourage further interaction, like "Take Another Quiz" or "Read More Tips."<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Social Sharing`: Include CTAs that prompt users to share their results on social media. |


!!! tip "Tip: Change CTAs"

    You can change the text of any button or CTA in your quiz in the [Quiz Settings > Messages](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#messages) section or directly in each question settings.


## üíå No Follow-Up

The interaction shouldn‚Äôt end with the quiz results. If you don‚Äôt follow up, you miss out on potential sales and customer relationships.

**Solution**

Have a follow-up plan. Send personalized emails with the quiz results, product recommendations, and special offers.

Use retargeting ads to remind users about their quiz results and encourage them to come back.


| Goal | Solution |
|------|-----------|
| **Increasing Sales** | ‚Ä¢ `Email Follow-Ups`: [Send personalized emails](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/) with product recommendations based on quiz results.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Special Offers`: Include exclusive [discounts](/how-to-guides/add-discount/) or offers in the follow-up to encourage purchases. |
| **Gathering Customer Data** | ‚Ä¢ `Survey Follow-Ups`: Send follow-up surveys to gather more detailed customer insights.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Profile Completion`: Encourage users to complete their profiles with follow-up emails. |
| **Engaging Your Audience** | ‚Ä¢ `Content Follow-Ups`: Provide additional content related to the quiz results, like blog posts or videos.<br><br>‚Ä¢ `Engagement Reminders`: Use follow-up emails to remind users of their quiz results and encourage further interaction. |

A well-made product quiz can be a game-changer for your online store. By avoiding these common mistakes and continually improving your quiz, you can create a better experience for your users and drive more sales. 

!!! tip "Key Takeaways"

# Quiz Success - üìã Setup Checklist

A step-by-step ‚Äúdon‚Äôt miss anything‚Äù guide before going live.

!!! info
    This checklist isn‚Äôt just theory ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **blueprint for success**. We built it by analyzing our **most successful, best-converting quizzes** from merchants in the beauty and supplements industries. These stores consistently achieve higher engagement, more completed quizzes, and stronger sales results by following these steps.

Think of it as your shortcut: if you follow this setup, you‚Äôll be building your quiz on the same foundation that has already worked for dozens of high-performing brands.

---

### **Step 1 ‚Äì Plan & Name Your Quiz**

Your quiz name sets the tone and expectation. A professional, problem-solving title makes customers take it seriously and increases engagement.


‚òê Define the customer problem your quiz should solve (e.g., find the right moisturizer, build a full routine) and make a quiz map with questions and outcomes.

‚òê Choose a professional name that matches your brand (*Shade Finder*, *Routine Builder*, *Skin Diagnostic*)

??? example "Example: Professional Quiz Name"

    ![quiz name example](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC3-ALPHAH-768x340.jpg)

---


### **Step 2 ‚Äì Build Questions**

Your [questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-types) should be **short, clear, and visual** when possible. Customers drop off if the quiz feels too long or confusing.

‚òê Add a **Welcome** slide that clearly sets expectations ‚Äî explain what the customer will gain from the quiz and how long it will take. Keep it visually engaging and highlight any reward for completion (e.g., a discount code or free gift).

‚òê Keep total length **5‚Äì6 questions** (under 2 minutes)

!!! warning
    We've noticed a significant drop-off in quiz completion rates when the quiz is over 6 questions-long and almost nobody makes it to question 12. Keep the quiz short and concise or it won't achieve the desired results.

‚òê Add **picture questions** for clarity and engagement (skin tones, hair colors, product types)

??? info "How to Add a Picture Question"

    Add a question by clicking `+ Add question` or `+ Add block`. Choose [Picture Choice](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#picture-choice) if you want to show images/icons instead of text-only answers.

    ![picture choice example1](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC6-LUCE-768x242.jpg)

    ![picture choice example2](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC5-TBJ-768x244.jpg)


---


### **Step 3 ‚Äì Add Personalization & Logic**

Personalization makes your quiz feel like a real consultation. [Smart logic](/how-to-guides/use-conditional-logic/) skips irrelevant questions and tailors advice to each customer.

‚òê Use [**Jump Logic**](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/) to branch into relevant paths OR [**Skip Logic**](/how-to-guides/use-skip-logic/) to hide irrelevant questions

??? example "Example: Showing different advice based on previous answers"

    ![jump logic example](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic.png)

    Check this article to learn how to branch the quiz based on previous answers: [How to Use Jump Logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/)


‚òê Add **personalized advice** on the results page (e.g., dry vs oily skin tips) and use [**Display Logic**](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/) for showing targeted advice (e.g., show different advice based on skin type)

??? example "Example: Advice based on calculated skin type"

    ![display logic example](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_variable_example1.png)

    Check this article to learn how to set up a quiz that determines the user's skin type and shows personalized advice and products: [How to Set Up a Winning Variable Quiz](/how-to-guides/set-up-scoring-quiz/#winning-variable-quiz)

‚òê Enable [Information Recalls](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) (e.g., greet by name, reuse answers)

??? example "Example: Recalling information from previous questions"

    ![information recalls example](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC8-Recalls.gif)

    Check this article to learn how to recall information from previous questions: [How to Use Information Recalls](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/)


---

### **Step 4 ‚Äì Configure Recommendations**

The power of a quiz lies in guiding customers to clear choices. Too many results cause decision fatigue, while focused suggestions drive purchases.

‚òê Show only **1 top product**

??? example "Example: Showing one matching product"

    ![recommendations example](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC7-UNDID_Blurred.png){width="500"}

‚òê Use **recommendation slots** for routines, 1 product per slot (cleanser, serum, toner, etc.)

??? example "Example: Skincare routine recommendations"

    ![recommendations example](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/images/how_to_recommend_slots_example.png)
    
    Check this article to learn how to set up a quiz that recommends a skincare routine: [How to Set Up a Funnel Quiz with Slots](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/set-up-funnel-quiz/#funnel-quiz-with-slots)

‚òê Apply a slot with **fixed recommendations** for best-sellers

??? info "How to Set Up Fixed Recommendations"

    Check this article to learn how to set up a quiz that recommends a best-seller: [How to Set Up a Funnel Quiz with Fixed Recommendations](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/set-up-fixed-recommendations-quiz/#always-the-same-recommendations)

---

### **Step 5 ‚Äì Design & Branding**

A quiz that visually matches your store feels like part of your brand and builds trust. Good design keeps the quiz engaging and boosts completion rates.

??? info "How to Customize Quiz Design"

    Check this article to learn how to customize the quiz design: [Customize Quiz Design](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/)

    Note that the `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app automatically pulls your Shopify theme‚Äôs base font.

    ![quiz design example](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC1-OLAPLEX_Blurred-1024x452.png)

‚òê Apply your **store fonts and color scheme**

‚òê Add a **background image** or icons that fit your style

‚òê Use the **visual block editor** to arrange quiz elements

‚òê Add **custom CSS/JS** for advanced tweaks


---

### **Step 6 ‚Äì Capture Leads & Send Results**

Collecting emails turns quiz takers into long-term customers. Sending results builds trust and creates opportunities for follow-up campaigns.

‚òê Add an [**email question**](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#email-address) to gather leads from the quiz

??? tip "Make the email question *optional*"

    To don't hurt your quiz conversions, you can make the email question optional in [email question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#email). This way users will be able to opt-out but still can see their results.

    ![email question settings](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_questions_blocksettings_email.png)


‚òê Enable [result emails](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/) to send results to the quiz takers who left their email

??? info "Tutorial: Sending Emails"

    Check this video tutorial to learn how to send emails with the RevenueHunt app: [Sending Emails](/tutorials/sending-emails/)

‚òê For advanced features, [connect the quiz to your CRM](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-crm/) (eg. Klaviyo, Omnisend, Mailchimp, Webhooks, etc.) and set up a follow-up email campaign

‚òê Personalize emails with quiz answers + product recommendations

---

### **Step 7 ‚Äì Add Incentives**

Rewards encourage customers to act immediately. A discount code is a simple but effective way to boost conversions after the quiz.

‚òê If you haven't yet, add a Welcome slide that clearly sets expectations ‚Äî explain what the customer will gain from the quiz and highlight any **reward for completion**.

‚òê If available for your platform, create and add an [automatic discount code](/how-to-guides/add-discount/) for quiz finishers

‚òê Create a discount code for quiz takers and **add the dicount code as text** to the quiz last question or results page

??? example "Example: Discount Code"

    ![discount code example](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC9-discount.gif)

---

### **Step 8 ‚Äì Publish Your Quiz**

Even the best quiz won‚Äôt help if no one sees it. Make your quiz highly visible across your store to maximize engagement. Most successful quizzes are **published in multiple locations** on the website to help customers at different stages of their shopping journey.

??? tip "Is there anything I can help you with?"

    Just like a real-life shop attendant, the quiz should reach out to the customers to ask *"Is there anything I can help you with?"*. 

    ![publishing your quiz](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC1-UN_DID_Blurred-768x402.png)

??? info "How to Publish Your Quiz"

    Check this article to learn how to publish your quiz in different ways: [How to Publish Your Quiz](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz/)


‚òê Add links to the quiz in the [**navigation menu**](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-link/#link-popup-in-website-menu)

‚òê Add a [**banner with a button**](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-link/#link-popup-as-take-the-quiz-button) to open the quiz

‚òê Add quiz as a [**inline block**](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-inline/#embedding-an-inline-quiz-on-a-dedicated-landing-page) on dedicated landing page or homepage

‚òê Set up an [**automatic popup**](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-automatic-popup/) for first-time visitors

---

### **Step 9 ‚Äì Optimize for Global Stores**

If you sell internationally, your quiz should adapt just like your store. Localization in language, currency, and products builds trust and increases sales abroad.

??? tip "How to Set Up a Quiz for Multiple Markets"

    In Markets tab of the app, assign a quiz to a specific Shopify Market. You can duplicate a quiz and translate it with Copilot for quick multi-language setup.

    Check this video tutorial to learn how to set up a quiz for multiple markets: [Assign Quizzes to Shopify Markets and Languages](/tutorials/shopify-markets/)

‚òê Create separate quizzes for **different languages**

‚òê Test **currency display** in Shopify Markets

‚òê Adjust recommendations for **region-specific needs**

‚òê Test quizzes in multiple markets to confirm smooth experience





---

‚úÖ Done! Your quiz is now ready to guide customers like a real store assistant ‚Äî driving higher engagement, more conversions, and global reach.

# How to Reduce Drop-off and Maximize Quiz Completion Rate

Quizzes can be a powerful tool to engage users, collect valuable data, and even segment your audience for targeted marketing. However, creating a quiz that maintains the user's interest from start to finish can be challenging. High drop-off rates can significantly affect the effectiveness of your quiz.

This guide offers practical steps and strategies to reduce drop-off rates and maximize quiz completion rates.

## Step 1: Review Drop-Off Metrics 

Start by examining the [drop-off metrics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#drop-off) provided by RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz. These metrics will highlight where participants are leaving the quiz, allowing you to pinpoint problem areas effectively.

![drop-off metrics](/images/manual_quizbuilder_metrics_dropoff.png)

!!! warning "Not available for `üíé Built for Shopify` version"

    The Drop-off data is not yet available for the `üíé Built for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app. But you can measure the drop off by connecting the quiz to [Google Analytics](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) or [Meta Pixel](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/).

**Which data to check?**

First, identify `High Drop-off Questions`.  Focus on questions with the highest drop-off rates, especially those asking for personal details like email addresses. These are typically where you might lose participants' interest or willingness to continue.

!!! info "Drop-off Rate Formulas"

    Overall Drop-off Rate: *Drop-off Rate (%) = [(Quiz Starts ‚Äì Quiz Completions) √∑ Quiz Starts] √ó 100* 

    Per-Question Drop-off Rate: *Drop-off Rate at Question i (%) = [(Users who reached Question i ‚Äì Users who reached Question i+1) √∑ Users who reached Question i] √ó 100*

    Completion Rate: *Completion Rate (%) = [Quiz Completions √∑ Quiz Starts] √ó 100*


Then, check the following metrics:

- `Start Rate` - % of page visitors who actually start the quiz. **Why?** Low = landing page headline/CTA issue, slow load, or poor value proposition.

- `Completion Rate` - % of quiz starts that reach the results screen. **Why?** The high-level success metric you‚Äôre trying to improve.

- `Per-Question Exit Rate` - Drop-off % at each question. **Why?** Pinpoints the exact step(s) causing abandonment.

- `Average Time Per Question` - Look for spikes: if one question takes 2‚Äì3√ó longer than others, it‚Äôs either confusing or too demanding.

- `Total Quiz Duration` - Average time from first to last question. **Why?** Compare against your design goal (‚â§60‚Äì90s). Longer times predict higher abandonment.

- `Lead Capture Metrics` - % of users who provide email when asked. **Why?** Check drop-off before vs. after this step ‚Äî forcing email can sink completions.

- `Leads per 100 Quiz Starts` - Combines completion + opt-in. Useful for seeing if completion rate tradeoffs are worth it.



## Step 2: Implement Strategies for Reducing Drop-off

Once you know where the problem is try implementing these strategies to reduce drop-off within your Product Recommendation Quiz:


### Value Up Front

- **Expose the value up front.** First screen: what they get + how long it takes. E.g., ‚ÄúTakes 45s. Get your routine + 10% off.‚Äù

- **Set a time budget.** Design for ‚â§60‚Äì90 seconds total or **max. 5‚Äì8 questions**. Anything longer needs a clear value promise (‚Äú3-step routine + 10% off‚Äù).


### Quiz Length & Flow

- **Kill irrelevant questions with branching.** Use [jump/skip logic](/how-to-guides/use-conditional-logic/) so each path is ‚â§6 questions. If a question doesn‚Äôt change the recommendation, remove it.

- **Sequence for momentum.** Start with the easiest, most visual questions; place the longest/most personal near the end.

- **Offer ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure.‚Äù** Add a neutral choice that still maps to a safe default. Users shouldn‚Äôt feel stuck.

### Question & Answer Design

- **Prefer tap over typing.** Replace text inputs with single-tap choices, sliders, or toggles. If text is unavoidable, one field per screen.

- **Shrink choices.** 3‚Äì6 options per screen; use images or icons; ensure options are mutually exclusive.

- **Keep copy scannable.** 1‚Äì2 short lines max per question. Use helper text only when it changes the answer.

### Email & Data Capture

- **Make email optional and valuable.** Label clearly (‚ÄúOptional‚Äù) and offer a specific incentive (e.g., ‚Äú10% off now‚Äù). Place it after value is built (last or second-to-last step). Make the email question optional in [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings) and clearly indicate this choice to the user.

- **Give results even without email.** Gate extras (PDF routine, detailed guide, bundle pricing) behind email ‚Äî not the core results.

- **Use trust cues at friction points.** Near the email step: ‚ÄúNo spam, unsubscribe anytime,‚Äù privacy link, and social proof (‚Äú2,184 shoppers helped this month‚Äù).


!!! tip "Tip: Email Question"

    Consider the value of obtaining a participant's email. Assess whether the potential long-term benefits, like building your email list for targeted marketing, outweigh the immediate goal of quiz completion.

### UX & Quiz page

- **Show progress the way humans parse it.** ‚Äú3 of 6‚Äù beats ‚Äú50%.‚Äù Keep the total constant (no adding hidden steps mid-flow).

- **Pause competing popups.** While quiz is active, hide newsletter/chat popups and overlays. Resume them after completion.

- **Reduce visual noise.** On the quiz page, hide sticky headers/footers, promo banners, and auto-carousels that steal focus.

- **Result screen matters.** Render the top picks instantly; place secondary content later on the page.

- **Accessibility = completions.** Proper labels, focus order, visible focus state, sufficient contrast. Screen-reader friendly progress (‚ÄúStep 2 of 6‚Äù).


## Step 3: A/B Test

Create a variation of your quiz with the implemented changes, such as making it shorter and adjusting the approach to collecting emails.

Run both the original and the modified quizzes simultaneously to see which version has a higher completion rate.

!!! tip

    Check our [How to A/B Test You Quiz](/how-to-guides/ab-test-quiz/) article for instructions.

## Step 4: Continous Improvement

Use the Product Recommendation Quiz [analytics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#analytics) or [GA4](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) to review the performance of both quiz versions.

Pay attention to the completion rates and participant feedback to understand what works best.

Continuously refine your quiz based on these insights, aiming for an optimal balance between information collection and user experience.

---

By closely monitoring in-app drop-off metrics and experimenting with different quiz formats and strategies, you can improve quiz completion rates.

# Product Quiz Metrics: What to Track to Convert Better

Data from product recommendation quizzes can significantly enhance your conversion rates. Understanding which metrics to track and how to interpret them is key to optimizing your quizzes for better performance. 

Here‚Äôs a guide on the most critical quiz metrics and how they can drive better conversion outcomes.

![product quiz metrics: what to track to convert better image1](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Quiz-Metrics.png)

## Where to find the data?

### ‚û°Ô∏è Quiz Metrics

All the information gathered by your RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz can be found in the [Metrics/Analytics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/) panel. 

- The [Responses](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) section shows all the quiz responses organized by date/timestamp. Click on a date to open a specific response. Each response shows what choices the customer made, which products were upvoted or excluded, which products were recommended, and what customer tags carried out until the results page.

    ![quiz builder metrics responses](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_responses.png)

    ![quiz builder metrics responses details](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_responses_sample1.png)

- The [Analytics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#analytics) section provides graphs on quiz engagement, conversion rate, and revenue. You can analyze the data by date and compare it to past periods or other quizzes.

    ![quiz builder metrics analytics](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_metrics_analytics.png)

- The [Drop Off](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#drop-off) section displays a breakdown percentage of users leaving certain questions in your quiz. The data is shown in a table and graph format.

    ![quiz builder metrics drop off](/images/manual_quizbuilder_metrics_dropoff.png)

    !!! warning "Not available for `üíé Built for Shopify` version"
        The Drop-off data is not yet available for the `üíé Built for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app.

###‚û°Ô∏è Download Raw Data

You can analyze the data there or [download all the responses as a .CSV file](/how-to-guides/download-quiz-responses/) and analyze it in Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel.

![quiz builder metrics responses download](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_responses_exportCSV.png)

###‚û°Ô∏è Advanced Tracking

Additionally, RevenueHunt app offers integrations with [Google Analytics](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) and [Meta Pixel](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/) where additional information like click rate per choice, traffic source or revenue can be collected and measured.


## What to analyze and how to improve?

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Engagement
 

**Quiz Starts and Completions**

Tracking the number of quiz starts and responses/completions is fundamental. High start rates indicate good initial engagement, but the completion rate is what truly matters for conversions. If you notice a drop-off between starts and completions, it might be time to refine your quiz flow or simplify the questions.

![quiz builder metrics analytics starts and completions](/images/cs_track_metrics_starts_responses.png)

!!! note

    `Quiz Starts` refers to the number of people who have engaged with the quiz by passing the first slide. 
    
    `Quiz Responses` refers to the number of people who have completed the quiz, aka. reached the quiz results page. 
    
    If the customer closes the quiz before the results page, this will not be counted as a response/completion.

**Completion Rate**

!!! info "Completion Rate Formula"  

    **Completion Rate (%)** = (Number of Quiz Completions √∑ Number of Quiz Starts) √ó 100


`Completion Rate` is the percentage of people who have engaged with the quiz and completed it. The completion rate is a clear indicator of how engaging and user-friendly your quiz is. A higher completion rate suggests that users find the quiz relevant and easy to navigate, which increases the likelihood of them following through to purchase recommendations. The aim is to keep the completion rate as high as possible, around 90-100%.

![quiz builder metrics analytics completion rate](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/images/manual_quizbuilder_metrics_analytics_comprate.png)

**Drop-off Points / Drop-off Rate**

Identifying where users drop off in your quiz can provide insights into potential friction points. Are users abandoning the quiz at a specific question or step? Use this data to adjust those points, making them more intuitive or engaging.

!!! note
    The `drop-off rate` is measured based on events, which are triggered whenever someone starts a quiz. Some of these start events can be blocked by adblocking plugins in browsers. If you see a difference between the number of quiz starts and the dropoff rate, that is because the number of quiz starts in the analytics tab is automatically adjusted by the algorithm to filter in also the starts blocked by the ad blocker plugin.

!!! warning "Not available for `üíé Built for Shopify` version"
    The Drop-off data is not yet available for the `üíé Built for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app.


| Issue                          | Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Low Quiz Starts**            | - **Make the quiz more visible.** Publish the quiz in multiple ways on your website, send a link to the quiz in your newsletter, or post a link on social media. <br> - **Promote the quiz.** Check [this article](/customer-success/how-to-get-more-quiz-engagement/) for great advice on how to increase your quiz starts. <br> - **Run ads to increase quiz popularity.** If using GA4, check the best traffic sources for your quiz and invest more in them. |
| **Low Completion Rate / High Drop Off** | - **Make the quiz shorter, max. 5-6 questions.** Customers are likely losing attention. <br> - **Add more visuals to the quiz.** Turn multiple-choice questions into picture questions. Add images and videos to your quiz. Visual quizzes have a much higher completion rate than pure text-based ones. <br> - **Check your mandatory questions.** Perhaps customers don‚Äôt want to leave their phone number, name, or email. You can make any question optional in [Question Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings). <br> - **Add personal data questions towards the end of the quiz.** Customers are more likely to stay and leave their data while already invested in the quiz. |


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue
 

**Carts Count and Total Carts Value**

Tracking how many users proceed to cart after completing the quiz can help you gauge the effectiveness of your product recommendations. A high cart count and total cart value indicate that the recommended products resonate well with the users.


![quiz builder metrics analytics carts count and value](/images/cs_track_metrics_number_carts.png)
![quiz builder metrics analytics carts count and value](/images/cs_track_metrics_tot_carts_value.png)

**Average Cart Value**

!!! info "Average Cart Value Formula"  
    
    **Average Cart Value** = Total Carts Value √∑ Carts Count

Understanding the average value of products in the carts can help you assess the monetary impact of your quiz. This metric is crucial for evaluating the overall financial performance and can guide you in setting appropriate pricing strategies.

![quiz builder metrics analytics average carts](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/images/manual_quizbuilder_metrics_analytics_avgcarts.png)

**Number of Orders and Total Orders Value**

For a more direct measure of conversion, track the number of orders placed and their total value, allowing you to directly correlate quiz engagement with sales performance.

!!! warning "Connect your quiz to Shopify Customers and Shopify Revenue Reports"

    Connect your quiz to [Shopify Customers](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-shopify-customers/) (and [Shopify Revenue Reports](/how-to-guides/track-quiz-revenue/?h=shopify+revenue#activate-shopify-revenue-report)) to track the number of orders and their total value.

![quiz builder metrics analytics number of orders and total orders value](/images/cs_track_metrics_orders.png)

**Average Order Value**

!!! info "Average Order Value Formula"  
    
    **Average Order Value** = Total Orders Value √∑ Number of Orders


Monitoring the average order value post-quiz completion provides insights into the spending behavior of your users. It helps in understanding whether the quiz is effectively driving higher-value purchases. By using RevnueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz in your store you should expect the AOV to increase by 20%.

**Conversion Rate**

!!! info "Conversion Rate Formula"  

    **Conversion Rate (%)** = (Number of Purchases after Quiz Completion √∑ Total Number of Quiz Completions) √ó 100


To measure the conversion rate of your quiz, track the number of users who complete the quiz and proceed to make a purchase, then calculate the percentage of these users relative to the total number of quiz completions. This metric is essential because it reveals how effectively the quiz drives sales, aiding in optimizing the quiz design and marketing strategies to maximize revenue.  By using a RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz in your store you should expect conversion rates bumped up from 2% to 5%.

# How to A/B Test Your Product Recommendation Quiz

A/B testing, or split testing, allows you to compare two versions of your quizzes to see which one performs better. 

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up A/B testing manually using your ability to create, duplicate, and edit quizzes in the RevenueHunt app.

Ensure you have:

- Access to the RevenueHunt app where you can create and edit quizzes.
- Basic understanding of [how to publish quizzes](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz/) on your website.
- Access to your website‚Äôs backend or a platform that allows you to edit HTML/JavaScript for traffic distribution (optional for advanced routing).
- Analytics tools or integration such as  [Google Analytics](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) or [Meta Pixel](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/). to measure quiz performance.

## Step 1: Create Two Versions of Your Quiz

- **Design Your Original Quiz**: Create your quiz (Version A) in the RevenueHunt app, focusing on the content and design that you currently believe will perform best.
- **Duplicate and Modify for Version B**: Use the duplication feature on the dashboard to make a copy of Version A. Alter one or more elements (e.g., title, color scheme, question order) to create Version B. Ensure only one key variable is different to accurately measure the effect of that change. Remember to publish the changes with the top-right Publish button.

## Step 2: Publish Both Versions on Your Website

Deploying both versions of your quiz on your website can be done through simple or advanced methods, depending on your ability to modify your site‚Äôs code and the level of precision you require in your A/B testing.

### No Coding Solution: Basic A/B Testing
For straightforward A/B testing, we recommend publishing each version of the quiz on separate pages within your store. This approach does not require any coding:

- **Inline Quiz on a New Page**: Create a new page for each version of the quiz (Version A and Version B). Follow the [Inline Quiz on a New Page](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-inline/#embedding-an-inline-quiz-on-a-new-page) publishing instructions to embed each quiz into its respective page. 

This method allows you to directly link to each quiz version from different parts of your website or through external marketing channels.

### Coding Solution: Advanced A/B Testing
If you‚Äôre aiming for a more sophisticated A/B testing setup that involves randomizing which quiz version a visitor sees, you‚Äôll need some coding:

- **Link Popup**: Implement a Link Popup method by creating a single entry point (like a button or link) that dynamically directs visitors to either Version A or Version B of the quiz. You will need to work with a developer to program the logic that decides which link to the quiz is shown to each visitor. Follow the [Link Popup Publishing Instructions](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-link/) for detailed steps on how to implement this solution.

By choosing the appropriate method based on your needs and capabilities, you can effectively publish and test different quiz versions on your website to gather insights and improve engagement.

## Step 3: Evenly Distribute Traffic Between Quizzes

To manually distribute traffic:

- For Basic Routing: Use two separate URLs for each quiz version and direct users randomly via your website‚Äôs links or promotions.
- For Advanced Routing: Implement a JavaScript snippet or server-side logic on your landing page that randomly serves Version A or Version B of the quiz to each new visitor.

## Step 4: Track and Analyze Results

- **Set Up Analytics**: Ensure each quiz version has tracking set up. By default, we track the quiz starts, completions, conversion rate, and drop-off in the [Metrics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/) panel. For more advanced analytics, you can connect your quizzes to [Google Analytics](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) or [Meta Pixel](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/).
- **Analyze Performance**: After a significant amount of traffic has interacted with both versions, analyze the data to identify which version achieved better performance based on your predefined goals (e.g., higher completion rates).

## Step 5: Implement Improvements

Based on the analysis, decide which version of the quiz is more effective. Implement the winning elements in your standard quiz and consider new variables to test in future A/B testing cycles.

## Tips for Effective A/B Testing

- Test one variable at a time to understand its impact clearly.
- Ensure you have a statistically significant sample size before drawing conclusions.

A/B testing for quizzes is entirely feasible with the RevenueHunt app. By following this guide, you can uncover valuable insights into what resonates with your audience, leading to better engagement and conversion rates over time.

# How to Add and Adjust Images in the Quiz


There are several ways you can add images to your quiz in the RevenueHunt app.

This article explains how you can add images to your quiz and provides tips on how to optimize the image quality for the best quiz performance.


## Images in the Quiz

There are the different ways you can add images to your quiz in the RevenueHunt app:

- **[Quiz Background image](/how-to-guides/add-adjust-images/#quiz-background-image)** - You can uplaod a background image for the whole quiz via the [Quiz Design tab](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/).

- **[Question Background/Split image](/how-to-guides/add-adjust-images/#question-backgroundsplit-image)** - You can upload a background image to each question in the quiz via the [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#picture-choice).

- **[Image Block](/how-to-guides/add-adjust-images/#image-blocks)** - You can upload an individual image via an Image Block directly into one of the quiz [questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) or [results page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/).

- **[Picture Choice](/how-to-guides/add-adjust-images/#picture-choices)** - You can add a [Picture Choice block](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#picture-choice) to your question, which will allow you to add an image to each choice in that multiple choice question.

- **[Product Image](/how-to-guides/add-adjust-images/#product-image)** - You can also add a [Product/Variants/Collection Block](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#product-image-in-productvariantscollection-blocks) to your quiz results page, which will allow you to display a product/variant/collection image in the results page.


### Quiz Background Image

    You can upload a background image for the whole quiz via the [Quiz Design tab](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/).
    ![how_to_shopifyv2_improve_image_quality_backgroudimagequiz](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_improve_image_quality_backgroudimagequiz.png)
    1. Open the [Quiz Design tab](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/)
    2. Click on `Background`
    3. Change the background color by clicking on the color. 
        !!! tip "Background color"
            The color of the background matters if you want to adjust the image opacity. A light colored background will make the image more visible, while a dark background will make the image more subtle. 
    5. Upload a background image by clicking `Select image`.
    4. Adjust the background opacity with the slider.
    6. Once uploaded, click `Change` to change the image or `Remove` to remove it. 
    !!! tip "Background image Tip"
        Our app uses a **responsive design**, meaning your quiz will adjust to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile). Because of this, **background images may crop or scale differently depending on the device**.
        To ensure your background looks great across all devices, we recommend:
        ‚úÖ Use large, high-resolution images: at least 1920x1080px (Full HD)
        ‚úÖ Avoid images with text ‚Äî it might be cut off or obscured
        ‚úÖ If needed, keep important elements (like logos or text) centered
        ‚úÖ Use soft, neutral backgrounds that won‚Äôt clash with quiz content
        ‚úÖ Test your quiz on different devices to see how the image behaves
        Remember, simpler is often better for responsive backgrounds!

    1. Open the [Question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#picture-choice)
    2. Click on `Image upload`
    3. Click `Select image` to upload a background image to this quiz question from your computer. You can also chose from existing images from your quiz gallery.
    4. In `Image position` you can choose between two options: `background` (for a full background image) or `split` (for a split image).  Each option has it's own settings explained below.
    5. Once uploaded click `Change`to change the image or `Remove` to remove it. 
    6. You can also adjust the `Image opacity` with the slider.
    !!! tip "Background/Split image Tip"
        Our app uses a **responsive design**, meaning your quiz will adjust to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile). Because of this, **background images may crop or scale differently depending on the device**.
        To ensure your background looks great across all devices, we recommend:
        ‚úÖ Use large, high-resolution images: at least 1920x1080px (Full HD)
        ‚úÖ Avoid images with text ‚Äî it might be cut off or obscured
        ‚úÖ If needed, keep important elements (like logos or text) centered
        ‚úÖ Use soft, neutral backgrounds that won‚Äôt clash with quiz content
        ‚úÖ Test your quiz on different devices to see how the image behaves
        Remember, simpler is often better for responsive backgrounds!
    **Background image settings**
    ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_questions_questionsettings_backgroundimage](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_questions_questionsettings_backgroundimage.png){width="300"}
    `Image layout` - Place the image as a `background` or `split` the screen in half with the image. 
    `Image opacity` - Use the slider to change opacity percentage of the uplaoded image.
    **Split image settings**
    ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_questions_questionsettings_splitimage](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_questions_questionsettings_splitimage.png)

    5. Remember to click the `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz.
    In the `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app, the `prq` object is not available. Instead, you have access to different objects:
    ### Available JavaScript data and functions
    **Questions**
  	```javascript
    // Data (live getters always return the latest state)
    Quiz.currentQuestion        // current question (index or object)
    Quiz.questions              // array of all questions
    Quiz.answers                // answers so far (by questionRef)
    Quiz.variableScores         // e.g., { skinSensitivity: 82, hydration: 45, ... }
    Quiz.highestVariableRef     // key/name of the highest-scoring variable
    // Navigation
    Quiz.next()                 // go to next question
    Quiz.previous()             // go to previous question
    // One-shot routing helper (next click will go to this q-or-r ref, then clears)
    Quiz.overrideNext('q-or-r-ref')
    // Event: fires after any answer update (choices/inputs)
    // event shape: { questionRef, blockRef, type, choicesRefs, value, isValid, selectedIndex, selectedLabel }
    Quiz.onChange = (event) => { /* your logic */ }
    // DOM helpers (scoped to the quiz)
    Quiz.querySelector(selector)  // like document.querySelector, but inside the quiz
    Quiz.getElementById(id)       // like document.getElementById, but inside the quiz
    // Examples:
    // 1) Route based on score (send next to a specific result)
    if (Quiz.variableScores.skinSensitivity > 80) {
      Quiz.overrideNext('r-premium');
    }
    // 2) React to answer changes and steer Next dynamically
    Quiz.onChange = (e) => {
      const answers = Quiz.answers; // live snapshot
      // decide destination based on current answers/scores
      Quiz.overrideNext('q-12345678');
    };
    ```
    **Results Page**
    ```javascript
    // Data
    Quiz.currentResult        // the result object (e.g., profile/outcome)
    Quiz.answers              // final answers
    Quiz.slotItems            // product recommendations shown in slots
    Quiz.variableScores       // scoring variables
    Quiz.highestVariableRef   // key/name of the highest scoring variable
    // Actions (async)
    await Quiz.addAllToCart()     // add all recommended products to cart
    await Quiz.applyDiscountCode()// apply the discount code configured
    // DOM helpers (scoped inside the quiz)
    Quiz.querySelector(sel)       // like document.querySelector, scoped to quiz
    Quiz.getElementById(id)       // like document.getElementById, scoped to quiz
    ```
    **Debugging and Accessing Data in V2**
    To explore available data in the `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app, you can add a `debugger` statement to your JavaScript code:
    ```javascript
    debugger;
    // Your code goes here
    ```
    When you view the quiz in your browser with Developer Tools open (F12), the code execution will pause at the debugger statement. In the Sources tab, you'll see the available parameters like `currentResult`, `answers`, and `slotItems`:
    ![debugger statement in browser](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_debugger_browser.png)
    You can then:
    1. Hover over these variables to inspect their values
    2. Use the console panel while paused to evaluate expressions
    3. Type these object names in the console to examine their structure
    Alternatively, you can use console.log to output these objects to the console:
    Questions
    ```javascript
    console.log('Current Question:', Quiz.currentQuestion);
    console.log('All Questions:', Quiz.questions);
    console.log('Answers so far:', Quiz.answers);
    console.log('Scores:', Quiz.variableScores);
    console.log('Top variable:', Quiz.highestVariableRef);
    ```
    Results Page
    ```javascript
    console.log('Current Result:', Quiz.currentResult);
    console.log('Final Answers:', Quiz.answers);
    console.log('Product Recommendations:', Quiz.slotItems);
    console.log('Scores:', Quiz.variableScores);
    console.log('Top variable:', Quiz.highestVariableRef);
    ```
    To access the console in your browser:
    1. Right-click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect" or press F12
    2. Click on the "Console" tab
    3. Look for your logged output
    This will help you understand the structure of these objects so you can access the specific properties you need in your custom JavaScript.
    In the `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app, you can add interactive elements to your quiz results page:
    1. Create an element in the result page and add the `onclick` functionality later via the Custom Javascript.
        !!! example "Add the `onclick` functionality via the Custom Javascript."
            ```html
            <!-- In Result page in a HTML block -->
            <!-- add a HTML element such as -->
            <a id="special_retake_quiz">Click here to retake the quiz</a>
            ```
            ```javascript
            /* In the Custom Javascript section */
            // get the element
            var element = document.getElementById("special_retake_quiz");
            // add the onclick function to the element
            element.onclick = function() {
                // You'll need to implement retake functionality using V2 objects
                // For example, you could redirect to the quiz URL
                window.location.href = window.location.href.split('#')[0] + '#quiz';
            }
            ```
    2. Or you can create the element in the Custom Javascript section and inject it into the results page.
        !!! example "Create the element with an `onclick` event first and then inject it in the results page."
            ```javascript
            /* In the Custom Javascript section */
            // create the element
            const element = document.createElement("a");
            element.innerHTML = "Click here to retake the quiz";
            element.style.cursor = "pointer";
            // add the onclick function
            element.onclick = function() {
              window.location.href = window.location.href.split('#')[0] + '#quiz';
            };
            // find a place to append the element
            const container = Quiz.querySelector('.result-section');
            if (container) container.appendChild(element);
            ```
    In the `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app, you can access the answers from the `answers` object to perform calculations. Here's how to create a BMI calculator:
    !!! example "Create a BMI calculator"
        Step 1: Add a placeholder element in the Results page (HTML block)
        ```html
        <div id="body_mass_index_calculation"></div>
        ```
        Step 2: Add custom JavaScript
        ```javascript
        /* In the Custom Javascript section */
        // Get the target element inside the quiz
        const element = Quiz.getElementById("body_mass_index_calculation");
        // Use Quiz.answers to find responses for weight and height
        // Replace these IDs with your actual question IDs from your quiz
        const weightAnswer = Quiz.answers["weight-question-id"];
        const heightAnswer = Quiz.answers["height-question-id"];
        if (element && weightAnswer && heightAnswer) {
          const weight = parseFloat(weightAnswer);
          const height = parseFloat(heightAnswer);
          if (!isNaN(weight) && !isNaN(height) && height > 0) {
            // Calculate BMI: weight (kg) / height^2 (m)
            const bmi = weight / (height * height);
            element.innerHTML = `Your BMI is: <b>${bmi.toFixed(2)}</b>`;
          } else {
            element.innerHTML = "Invalid data for BMI calculation.";
          }
        } else if (element) {
          element.innerHTML = "Required data not found.";
        }
        ```
        Step 3: Debugging (find your actual question IDs)
        ```javascript
        console.log("All Answers:", Quiz.answers);
        ```
        When you run the quiz, check the Console in DevTools to see the structure of `Quiz.answers` and copy the correct IDs to use in the code above.
    You can make question choice become select all / selectnone via the [Multiple-Choice settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#multiple-choice). 
    In this version of the Revenuehunt app you can direct users to different markets via the [App Settings > Shopify Markets tab](/reference/app-settings/#shopify-markets) and the product will be already shown in the right language and currency. 
    **Questions**

# How to Add Product Metafields/Attributes

This article explains how to add product metafields/attributes to products on your quiz's results page.

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/35b00cdff0d845e1b53ede28a9404efa?sid=ce797520-987e-4ed5-b917-d43f346efdcd" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    !!! note
        The app can only sync and show the string, single_line_text_field, multi_line_text_field, date, and number product metafields. Rich_text_fields metafields are not currently supported.
    [Metafields](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/custom-data/metafields) in Shopify are used by stores to display specific product properties that aren't shown by default on e-commerce platforms. For instance, in Germany, it's required to show the "grundpreis" or `per 100ml` price for cosmetic products. Metafields make this possible.
    In the `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app, the process for adding and displaying metafields is streamlined. Follow the steps outlined below to import product metafields from your store into the Product Recommendation Quiz and display them on your quiz's results page:
    **Step 1: Enable Metafields Display**
    To enable the display of metafields for individual products:
    1. Navigate to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) tab in the Quiz Builder.
    2. Add a [Product block](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections) and open its settings.
    3. In the [`Product components layout`](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#product-components-layout), click `+ block`and add the `Metafield`section.
      ![Add Metafield block](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_blocksettings_products_addblock.png){width=50%}
    4. From the `Select metafield` section, select the metafield you want to display.
    5. Alternatively, you can add a `Text` block to your product layout and add the metafield value manually as a [content dynamic source](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) to make it part of a block of text. 
    6. Save the changes with the top-right `Save` button.
    From now on the selcted metafiled will be dynamically displayed in the product block as part of the recommended product.
    !!! tip
        If you're missing custom metafileds from the list of available metafields, you can force a catalog sync:
        1. Go to [App Settings > Catalogue](/reference/app-settings/#catalogue).
        2. Click the `Import catalogue` button to trigger a manual sync.

    ![manual_standalone_succcesschecklist_productfeed](/images/manual_standalone_succcesschecklist_productfeed.png)


    !!! warning 

        You cannot just upload any data source file to the RevenueHunt app. The file must be a **valid Google Product Feed XML file**.

        - Shopify (if your store is on Shopify): Go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Files` in your Shopify admin. Upload `google_product_feed.xml`. Copy the URL Shopify gives you (it will look like `https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/.../google_product_feed.xml`).

        - Your own website / hosting: Upload the file via FTP, cPanel File Manager, or your CMS‚Äôs media upload.

        - Cloud storage: Use Dropbox, Google Drive (with direct link), or Amazon S3 ‚Äî but make sure the link is public and ends with `.xml`.

2. Once the link is added, the app will automatically upload products and collections to your quiz account.


    !!! warning "Your Google Product Feed doesn't work?"

        First, make sure that your file is a valid Google Product Feed XML file. Review the Google [Documentation](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/12631822?hl=en) guide.

        You should also try [this validation service](https://developers.google.com/product-review-feeds/validation/) to check for problems.

# Why Products Aren't Added to the Cart?

If your products are not added to the cart, here are the most probable causes:

## Your quiz is not published on a live website

The quiz needs to be published on live website (not hidden by a ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù plugin or password). 

!!! tip

    Check [this article](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz/) to learn how to publish your quiz.

## You‚Äôre using a cart drawer

Our RevenueHunt app does not integrate with drawer carts at the moment. So after the quiz is over, the quiz is adding products to the ‚Äúregular‚Äù cart instead of the drawer cart in your theme.

!!! warning "Cart Drawer"

    Check this article: [How to Update Your Shopify Cart Drawer Products After the Quiz](/how-to-guides/update-shopify-cart-drawer/) 

    This guide explains:

    - How RevenueHunt quiz app adds products to the Shopify cart

    - Why the cart drawer may not update

    - What your theme editor or developer can do to fix it

Unfortunately, drawer carts are an added functionality by specific store themes, not a core Shopify feature. Because of that, we cannot integrate with all the different themes that have drawer carts at the moment. However, there are a few ways this can be solved. Check the [How to Update Your Shopify Cart Drawer Products After the Quiz article](/how-to-guides/update-shopify-cart-drawer/) for more information.

**Option 1: Configure your Shopify theme to handle cart updates**

If you configure your Shopify theme to handle cart updates, it may be possible to integrate with drawer carts directly from the quiz.
    
!!! tip

    Check [this article](/how-to-guides/update-shopify-cart-drawer/) to learn how quiz adds products to the cart and how to configure your Shopify theme to handle cart updates.

**Option 2: Send the customer to the product page**

You could, instead of adding the product to the cart, send the customer to the product page by changing the checkout settings. They will be able to add the product to the drawer cart from there.

!!! tip

    Check [this article](/how-to-guides/change-checkout-settings/) to learn how to change your checkout settings.


## Your product is a subscription product

RevenueHunt app is able to sync and recommend subscription products created with ReCharge Subscriptions for Shopify. Check [here](/how-to-guides/recommend-subscription-products/) for instructions on how to enable it.

For other subscription apps, there's a [workaround](/how-to-guides/recommend-subscription-products/#other-subscriptions) that allows you to still guide your customers towards subscription options via the RevenueHunt app.

# How to Ensure a Specific Product Always Appears on Your Results Page

This guide provides a clear, step-by-step process to making sure that specific products are always visible on the Results Page of your quiz, regardless of the customer's choices.

!!! warning "Understand the voting system first"

    The backbone of personalized product recommendations is an algorithm that functions like a [voting system](#how-to-recommend-products), where products gain 'votes' based on customer selections in a quiz. The more votes a product has by the end of the quiz, the more likely it is to be displayed on the Results Page. Familiarizing yourself with [this recommendation mechanism](#how-to-recommend-products) is essential for effectively implementing the strategies outlined below.

## Strategy 1: Link Your Product to Every Choice

This approach ensures your chosen product always tops the Results Page by securing the most votes.

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

1. Navigate to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and locate the question you want to modify.
    2. Click on each choice/answer in your question to open the [choice settings](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) upvote products.
    3. Find and select your product to link it to each individual choice.
    4. Repeat this process for all choices across all questions in your quiz.
    By linking your product to every possible answer, you ensure it receives votes regardless of which options customers select.
    1. **Create a Collection for Your Featured Products**: In your Shopify admin, create a dedicated collection for the products you want to always recommend.
    2. **Create a Dedicated Product Slot**: Navigate to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) tab. Add new block and find the `Products` section. In [Products settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#block-types), select the `Recommendation System` to be `Fixed recommendations`. Give it a meaningful name like "Featured Products"
    3. **Configure the Product Slot**: In the slot settings, select `Include` and choose your featured products collection.
    4. **Save and Preview**: Click the `Save` button and preview your quiz to ensure your featured products appear in their dedicated slot, regardless of the answers selected.

# How to Ask for Marketing/Data Processing Consent

Directly asking for marketing consent or acceptance of data processing in your quiz can be a straightforward and efficient way to ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR.

This article outlines several methods to integrate consent requests seamlessly into your quizzes.

!!! note

    Check our latest article [Smart Ways to Ask for Marketing/Data Processing Consent in Your Product Recommendation Quiz](/customer-success/ask-marketing-consent/) to learn more.

## Add a Link to Your Privacy Policy

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

A fundamental step in asking for consent is to make your Privacy Policy easily accessible. You can link to your Privacy Policy within any text element of the quiz.
    For example, like this:
    ![how_to_askconsent_addlinktopolicy](/images/how_to_askconsent_addlinktopolicy.png)
    You can inform the customer in any text block that by providing the email address they agree to receive marketing information.
    1. To show an extra text block go to the [quiz builder](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) select a question, cliock `+ Add block` to add a text block.
    3. A text field will appear where you can add your consent text.
    4. Include a link to your privacy policy using the link feature in the text box, e.g., `[privacy policy](https://www.linktoyourprivacypolicy.com)`
    5. Publish your changes using the `Save` button located at the top-right corner.
    Create a marketing consent checkbox by combining quiz blocks on one question to ensure users actively consent before proceeding.
    1. Go to the [quiz builder](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) and place a `Multiple Choice` question right after the `email/phone` question slide.
    2. Add a single choice with your consent text, e.g., `I consent to process my data for marketing purposes.`
    3. This connects the two questions, requiring users to select the marketing consent option to proceed with the quiz.

        If the **compare-at price** is missing or showing as `null` on the quiz results page, this is often due to **Shopify Markets settings**. By default, Shopify can hide compare-at prices for customers in certain regions‚Äîespecially in the **European Economic Area (EEA)**‚Äîdue to local pricing or legal restrictions.
        How to Fix It:
        Go to **Shopify Admin ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Markets ‚Üí Preferences** and ensure that compare-at prices are enabled for the relevant market (e.g., Germany or the EEA). 
        ![how_to_shopifyv2_change_quiz_languge_markets_compareatissue](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_change_quiz_languge_markets_compareatissue.png)
        You can test this by previewing the quiz on your live store while simulating a visitor from the affected country.

    !!! tip "Tutorial"
        Check our step by step tutorial on how to set up Shopify Markets and assign quizzes to different markets and languages with the RevenueHunt app: [Assign Quizzes to Shopify Markets and Languages](/tutorials/shopify-markets/).
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 53.125%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c0exzYPtydo?si=X5ULbSjqG7wQ2Izd&amp;start=106" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    Before assigning quizzes to specific markets and languages, you‚Äôll need to create and customize the quiz versions for each language. Here‚Äôs how:
    **Step 1: Create Your Initial Quiz:**
    - Start by creating a [`new quiz`](/reference/dashboard/#new-quiz) with the basic content and questions you want to include.
    - Save this quiz as your base version, which you‚Äôll use to duplicate for different languages.
    **Step 2: Duplicate the Quiz for Each Language:**
    - From the [Dashbaord](/reference/dashboard/), select the option to `Duplicate` your original quiz or ask [Quiz Copilot](/how-to-guides/use-quiz-copilot/) to create a new translated quiz copy for you.
      ![manual_shopifyV2_quizmanagementoptions](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizmanagementoptions.png)
    !!! tip
        [Quiz Copilot](/how-to-guides/use-quiz-copilot/) can be used to translate and duplicate quizzes. Just open a chat with it and ask it to duplicate the main quiz for you in a different language.
    - For each duplicate quiz, go into the [`Quiz settings > Quiz content`](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#messages) and update the language for all buttons, popups, and other interface elements.
      ![/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizsettings_quizcontent.png](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizsettings_quizcontent.png)
    **Step 3: Translate Questions and Choices Separately:**
    Unless you've used [Quiz Copilot](/how-to-guides/use-quiz-copilot/) to translate the quiz, the questions and answer choices won‚Äôt automatically translate; you‚Äôll need to manually update these for each language version. 
    - Go through each question and answer choice to ensure they are accurately translated and culturally relevant for each target language.
    **Step 4: Change Translations for Buttons and Helpers:**
    - Go to the [Quiz Settings > Content](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#content) tab.
    - Change the translations for buttons and helpers for each language version.
    **Step 5: Assign the Quiz to the Right Market and Language:**
    !!! tip "Tutorial"
        Check our step by step tutorial on how to set up Shopify Markets and assign quizzes to different markets and languages with the RevenueHunt app: [Assign Quizzes to Shopify Markets and Languages](/tutorials/shopify-markets/).
    - Once each quiz version is ready, go to [App Settings > Shopify Markets](/reference/app-settings/#markets).
    - Select the appropriate market and language, and link each translated quiz to its respective locale. This will ensure that visitors see the correct quiz based on their market and language settings.
    By following these steps, you‚Äôll have a well-localized quiz experience ready for each market and language, which you can then manage seamlessly in the Shopify Markets tab of your app settings.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 53.125%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c0exzYPtydo?si=e_mX9xdaiB24xXaT&amp;start=175" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    !!! tip "Tutorial"
        Check our step by step tutorial on how to set up Shopify Markets and assign quizzes to different markets and languages with the RevenueHunt app: [Assign Quizzes to Shopify Markets and Languages](/tutorials/shopify-markets/).
    Our RevenueHunt app allows you to tailor the shopping experience for customers worldwide by selecting specific quizzes for each Shopify Market and its associated languages. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to help you change your quiz language based on the visitor‚Äôs location and language preference.
    **Step 1: Navigate to the Shopify Markets Settings**
    - Log in to your Shopify Admin Panel.
    - In the left-hand menu, go to Apps and select `RevenueHunt`.
    - Once in the app, look for [App Settings](/reference/app-settings/) and select the [Shopify Markets](/reference/app-settings/#markets) tab.
    **Step 2: Assign a Quiz to a Specific Shopify Market**
    - In the [Shopify Markets](/reference/app-settings/#markets) tab, you‚Äôll see a `dropdown list` that shows all available quizzes.
    - From the Shopify Markets section, select the Shopify Market where you‚Äôd like to assign a quiz.
      ![manual_shopifyV2_appsettings_markets_pickquiz](/images/manual_shopifyV2_appsettings_markets_pickquiz.png)
    - Choose the default quiz you want displayed to visitors in this Market from the dropdown.
    **Step 3: Show All Locales for Language Customization**
    If you want to customize quizzes based on both market and language:
    - Toggle the `Show All Locales` option to display a detailed list of markets and associated languages.
    - You‚Äôll now be able to assign different quizzes for each language within the same market:
      *Example: For the United States market, you can set one quiz for English-speaking customers and another for Spanish-speaking customers.*
    **Step 4: Select the Quiz for Each Locale**
    - With all locales shown, go to the specific language you want to adjust.
    - From the dropdown menu for that locale, pick the quiz that best matches the needs of that language group.
    - Save your changes to ensure the new language-specific quiz assignments are applied.
    **Step 5: Hide All Locales for Simplified View**
    If you‚Äôd like to revert to a single quiz for a Market regardless of language:
    ![manual_shopifyV2_appsettings_markets_showall](/images/manual_shopifyV2_appsettings_markets_showall.png)
    - Click the `Hide All Locales` option. This will simplify the view by removing language-specific distinctions.
    - The default quiz you‚Äôve selected for that Market will now display to all visitors from that region, regardless of their language.
    By following these steps, you‚Äôll be able to customize your quizzes by Market and language, ensuring each visitor has a tailored experience that feels relevant and engaging.

# How to Check Quiz Loading Speed

When integrating a quiz into your online store, it's crucial to ensure it loads efficiently to maintain a smooth user experience. If you're encountering slow loading times for your quiz, the issue might not stem from the quiz itself but from other resources on your site affecting its performance. 

This guide outlines steps to diagnose and resolve quiz loading issues by optimizing the loading process.

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

**Step 1: Verify Direct Quiz Link Performance**
    First, isolate the quiz from your site's environment to determine if the issue lies within the quiz or your website.
    1. **Locate Your Quiz Link**: Find the direct URL of your quiz. This can be obtained from the `Share -> External` tab of your quiz platform. 
        - The link should look something like [https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/rkHm6Y](https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/rkHm6Y) or [https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/#quiz-rkHm6Y](https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/#quiz-rkHm6Y), where `rkHm6Y` represents your unique `quiz ID`.
    2. **Test Loading Speed**: Open the direct link in a browser to see how quickly the quiz loads independently of your site. Ideally, the quiz should load in less than one second.
    If the quiz loads quickly via the direct link, the slow loading times are likely caused by other elements on your website.
    !!! tip
        Try [https://pagespeed.web.dev/](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to check the direct quiz link performance.
    ---
    **Step 2: Analyze Your Website's Loading Order**
    !!! info
        The new Built for Shopify version of the RevenueHunt app integrates the quiz as a native Shopify block within the Theme.
    Investigating the loading sequence of your website's resources can help identify what's slowing down the quiz when embedded in your site.
    1. **Open Developer Tools**: Right-click on your website in the browser and select `Inspect` to open the developer tools.
    2. **Review Network and Performance**: Navigate to the `Network` or `Performance` tabs to examine which resources are loading and how long each takes.
    Look for resources that significantly delay loading times, as these are likely culprits affecting the quiz's performance on your site.
    !!! tip
        Try [https://pagespeed.web.dev/](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to check the quiz page performance.
    ---
    **Step 3: Optimize Your Website's Resources**
    Consult your developer to review and optimize the loading of resources on your site. This may involve compressing images, minimizing CSS and JavaScript files, and removing unnecessary plugins or widgets. 
    - **Optimize Third-Party Widgets**: Review any third-party widgets or scripts (e.g., marketing, chat tools) on your site. Ensure that they are loaded asynchronously or deferred to load after the quiz.
    - **Check Shopify Performance Reports**: Use [Shopify‚Äôs built-in tools](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/web-performance/improving-web-performance) to check for any resources that might be blocking the quiz from loading quickly.

# How to Copy the Quiz from One Store to Another

Transferring a quiz from one store to another with the RevenueHunt app is straightforward. This process allows you to duplicate your quiz design, questions, tags, and the results page, however, **products and collections will not be transferred** due to differing product IDs in the new store.

!!! warning
    Before you begin, ensure the [RevenueHunt app](https://revenuehunt.com/product-recommendation-quiz-shopify/) is installed on both the original and the new store.


!!! warning

    It is not possible to copy a quiz created with the legacy version of the RevenueHunt app into the new Built for Shopify version of the app.

This article will guide you through the process of copying a quiz from one store to another.

## Copying the Quiz

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/0a2453ead2b44b3fb7df5cb17a72e3e2?sid=5912fafd-7f72-432c-8fd1-a870d5a4cdc0" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    **Step 1: Generate Export Quiz Code**
    First, navigate to the quiz you wish to export:
    1. Go to [Quiz Settings > General](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/).
    2. Search for **Export quiz to another store** and click `Copy quiz code`. The button generates a unique piece of JSON code that allows you to copy the entire quiz from one store to another. It remains valid for only 1 hour.
        ![Export Quiz Step](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizsettings.png)
        !!! tip
            To prevent loss, save the export quiz code in a text file.
    **Step 2: Log in to the Other Store**
    Ensure you're logged into the destination store:
    1. Log in to the new store's Shopify account in an Incognito/Private browsing mode. This way you can avoid being logged into multiple accounts on the same browser and prevent caching issues.
    2. Open the RevenueHunt app from the store's dashboard.
    **Step 3: Import the Quiz**
    Finally, import the quiz into your new store:
    1. In the RevenueHunt app, navigate to the [Dashboard](/reference/dashboard/).
    2. Click on the [New Quiz](/reference/dashboard/#new-quiz) option.
        ![manual_shopifyV2_createquiz](/images/manual_shopifyV2_createquiz.png)
    3. Choose **Import quiz** and paste the previously generated code.
        ![Import Quiz Step](/images/manual_shopifyV2_createquiz_importquiz.png)
    After completing these steps, the imported quiz will appear in your dashboard with a `- imported from QUIZID` suffix in its name.
    If you‚Äôre only changing the domain name (from `example.com` to `example-two.com`) and NOT changing the Shopify account (aka `.myshopify.com` address) the process shouldn‚Äôt disturb the RevenueHunt app and your quizzes. You can do so safely.
    If you‚Äôre changing the `.myshopify` account, then check [this guide](#how-to-copy-the-quiz-from-one-store-to-another) to copy the quiz from one store to another. After the quiz is copied, you may need to link your products to choices again, as they will have different product IDs in your new store. Make sure you‚Äôre **not** logged into two Shopify accounts at the same time on the same browser. This may cause caching issues. Instead, use Incognito / Private browsing for the second account.

    3. **Name your quiz**: The name can be edited later.
    4. **Redirect to Quiz Builder**: After that, you'll be redirected to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/).

    3. **Delete slides**: To delete a question, click the `üóë Remove question` button in [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).
    Once you have your questions, you'll have to decide [how to set up product recommendations](/how-to-guides/set-up-recommendations/) that should be shown at the end of the quiz. 
    You can choose to:
    **Option 1**: Recommend most voted products based on the customer's answers *(recommended for most quizzes)*
    ![Recommend Most Voted Products](/images/how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_funnel.png){: width="500"}
    In this setup, you'll have to:
    - Link products or collections to each choice in the quiz. 
    - On the Results Page, add a product block that will recommend the most voted products based on the customer's answers.
    - You can also sort recommendations into multiple product slots to show a complete product routine.
    **Option 2**: Set up a custom varaible or a score that will determine what recommendations should be shown *(recommended for personality-type quizzes)*
    ![Scoring Quiz](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_scoringquiz_varaiblequiz.png){: width="500"}
    In this setup, you'll have to:
    - Create a custom variable or a score for each choices in the quiz. 
    - On the Results Page, set up multiple sections with fixed recommendations and content.
    - To each section, add display logic to tell it when to be shown or hidden based on the final score or variable with the most votes. 
    - *For example, show Section 1 if the varaibkle with the highest score is "blue" and Section 2 if the varaibkle with the highest score is "red".*
    **Option 3**: Set up a complex logic tree or add display logic to sections on the results page that will determine what recommendations should be shown *(recommended for quizzes with complex logic and recommendations matrix)*
    ![Recommendations Matrix](/images/how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_logic.png){: width="500"}
    In this setup, you'll have to either:
    - Create complex logic branching in the quiz that leads the user to different results pages with fixed recomemendations and text 
    - Create one results page with multple sections and via display logic tell each section when to be shown or hidden based on the customer's answers.
    !!! tip
        If you're not sure which option to choose, check out our [How to Set Up Recommendations guide](/how-to-guides/set-up-recommendations/) that contains a decision tree to help you choose the best option for your quiz.

    !!! tip "Get help with custom CSS"
        Click `‚ú®Get help with custom CSS` to open a chat window with the Quiz Copilot AI. It can directly make design changes with CSS code!
    Once you've made your changes, click the `Save` button at the top right to apply them to your live or preview quiz.
    To add custom CSS code to a **speciifc quiz section only**, go to [`Question Settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).
    To add custom CSS code to a **specific results page only**, go to [`Results Page Settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/).
    !!! tip "Tips for using CSS"
        - **Check the App CSS Structure**: For a detailed overview of the CSS structure of the app and CSS examples, see the [App CSS Structure](/reference/css-structure/) reference.
        - **Find an Element Selector**: To target a specific element in your quiz, right-click on it in your browser and select `Inspect` to view the element‚Äôs selector.
        - **Add Specificity to CSS Rules**: Use specific selectors to apply styles only to particular parts of your quiz. 
            !!! example "Example: Add Specificity to CSS Rules"
                ```css
                #quiz p { color: red; }
                ```
                This rule will change the color of all paragraphs in the quiz to red.
                To style a paragraph in only one specific question, use the question's unique ID:
                ```css
                #question-AbC7Zde p { color: red; }
                ```
                In this case, the color of the paragraph will change to red only for the question with ID `AbC7Zde`. You can find a question‚Äôs ID in [`Quiz Builder > Question Settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).
    !!! example "Example: Upload a Google Font with CSS"
        1. **Find a Google Font**: To upload a custom Google Font to the quiz, first navigate to the font‚Äôs page. For example: [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand).
        2. **Copy Font code**: Then, select the styles you want to be applied and copy the import font URL and font family CSS rules.
        3. **Write CSS code**: To add a Google font to the quiz elements (h1-h6, p) use this sample code:
            !!! example "Example: Google Font Code"
                ```html
                @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Quicksand&display=swap');
                .quicksand-font {
                font-family: "Quicksand", serif;
                font-optical-sizing: auto;
                font-weight: 400;
                font-style: normal;
                }
                h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, button, div{
                font-family: 'Quicksand', sans-serif ;
                }
                ```
        5. **Paste the code in Quiz Design > CSS console**: Navigate to the Quiz Design > Custom CSS section of the app and paste the code into the custom CSS field on top of the stylesheet.

                For example, `Price` `is less than` `20 euros`.
                or `Price` `is greater than` `50 euros`.
                or `Price` `is between` `20 euros` and `50 euros`.
                ![filter by price example](/images/how_to_filter_by_price_smart_collection_example.png)

        - Repeat the process to create: 
            - A collection for products between 20 and 50 euros (Price `> 20` and Price `< 50`).
            - A collection for products over 50 euros (Price `> 50`).
        - Save each collection after setting the conditions.
    3. **Configuring the Quiz to Filter Recommendations**: Return to the Revenue Hunt Quizzes app and open your quiz. Locate the price question and expand it to configure options.

        !!! example "Configuring the Quiz to Filter Recommendations"
            - For the 'Under 20 euros' choice: Upvote the collection for products under 20 euros. Exclude collections for products between 20 and 50 euros and over 50 euros.
            - For the '20 to 50 euros' choice: Upvote the collection for products between 20 and 50 euros. Exclude collections for products under 20 euros and over 50 euros.
            - For the 'Over 50 euros' choice: Upvote the collection for products over 50 euros. Exclude collections for products under 20 euros and between 20 and 50 euros.
            ![filter by collection example](https://loom.com/i/f2089b6648004d739a40997d7ebf81ec?workflows_screenshot=true)
    4. **Testing the Price Filter Functionality**: Preview the quiz to test the filtering functionality. Select the option for products over 50 euros to verify that only those products are displayed. Repeat the test for the other price ranges to ensure accurate filtering. Confirm that the recommendations reflect the selected price range correctly.
        !!! tip "Troubleshooting"
            Check the [Response Analysis](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#response-analysis) tool in case of wrong recommendations.
            It may also be necessary to run a quick [catalog sync](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/) in case of wrong recommendations.

# Fixing Viewport Issue on Mobile

## Introduction

This guide addresses a common issue where the form on mobile devices is not fixed and moves from side to side, causing a poor user experience. This problem can be resolved by adjusting the meta viewport tag in the store's HTML.

## Problem Description

Users have reported that on mobile devices, the form page slightly zooms in when focusing on a text input, causing the page to move from left to right and resulting in a poor user experience. This issue needs to be addressed to ensure the form remains fixed on mobile devices.

## Solution

To fix this issue, the developer needs to modify the meta viewport tag in the store's HTML. The tag should include `maximum-scale=1.0` and `user-scalable=0` to prevent the page from moving.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. Locate the meta viewport tag in the HTML of your store. It might look like this:

   ```html
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0">
   ```

2. Modify the tag to include `maximum-scale=1.0` and `user-scalable=0`:

   ```html
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0">
   ```

3. If the meta viewport tag is missing, add the modified tag to the `<head>` section of your HTML.

![Fix viewport issue mobile](/images/fix_viewport_issue_mobile.png)

## Testing

After making these changes, test the form on a mobile device to ensure it remains fixed and does not move from side to side.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the changes are applied to the correct HTML file in your store.
- If you encounter any issues, consider reaching out to your web developer for assistance.

# How to Show or Hide Content Based on Quiz Answers

In this article, you‚Äôll discover how to use `IF-THEN` conditional logic to hide or show certain questions or sections based on customer answers to quiz questions. This includes conditionally hiding certain questions or statements within your quiz using [Jump Logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/) or [Skip Logic](/how-to-guides/use-skip-logic/) and showing or hiding blocks/sections on the Results page with [Display Logic](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/).

Using a skincare routine quiz as an example, we'll show how custom text and result can be displayed based on the customer‚Äôs skin type.

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

<div class="videoWrapper">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s71v8NfNRWk?si=c-8mefpQoHOvppvX" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N2gudKAy4qU?si=hcgIntH-XecaQxua" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    ![how to hide content with logic jump logic](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_jump_logic_flow.png)
    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add a `Multiple choice question` asking the customer about their skin type: Dry, Normal, Oily, or Combination-type skin. 
        !!! tip
            Use the [images or text blocks](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) to help customers determine their skin type.
    2. **Create Statement Questions**: Add multiple `Statement` slides describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:
        !!! example
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness ‚Äì we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that‚Äôs deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn‚Äôt experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin‚Äôs natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
    3. **Add Jump Logic**: If we don‚Äôt add jump logic to the quiz, our statement questions will just appear one after the other, regardless of the choice we made. 
        To add jump logic, you should to the [conditional logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab and select the Skin type question. 
        Then, Set up `IF-THEN` statements with `OR` logic to direct the customer to the correct text based on their skin type.  Like this:
        ![how to hide content with logic jump logic statement](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_jump_logic_rule.png)
        Click `+Add another rule (OR)` to add similar Jump Logic rules to direct the user to the Dry, Normal and Combination-Type skin respectively.
        This will ensure that each answer from the Skin Type question will lead tio the right statement.
    4. **Add Default destination Logic**: Once all the statements are linked with logic to the skin type question, you should point each statement to the next question in the quiz. 
        This is done by going to the [jump logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/) tab and scrolling toward the `Default destination` section. Point each statement to the next question.
        ![how to hide content with logic shopifyv2 jump logic default destination](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_jump_logic_default_destination.png)
    4. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oORLg_BU0fI?si=h7Ortp7mpm1wzTHu" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add a `Multiple choice question` asking the customer about their skin type: Dry, Normal, Oily, or Combination-type skin. 
        !!! tip
            Use the [images or text blocks](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) to help customers determine their skin type.
    2. **Add Content Sections to Results Page**: Go to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) and add a new `sections`. To add a new section click the `+ Add section` sign. 
        Add multiple content blocks describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:
        ![how to hide content with logic shopifyv2 display logic sections](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_display_logic_sections.png)
        !!! example
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness ‚Äì we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that‚Äôs deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn‚Äôt experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin‚Äôs natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
    3. **Add Display Logic**: If we don't add [Display Logic](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/) to the quiz, our blocks will just appear one after the other on the Results Page, regardless of the choice we made. 
        ---
        **Display logic operators**
        `+ Add condition (OR)` - Adds a new OR display logic rule.
        `+ Add condtion (AND)` - Adds a new AND logical statement to the same rule. AND conditional statements can be tricky, as both statements have to be true for the rule to take effect. For most quizzes, using the OR rule is enough.
        `bin` - Delete the current Logic rule.
        `+ Add condition (OR)` - Adds another Display Logic rule. Adds a new OR logical rule.
        `Default` - Select whether this section should be `Shown` or `Hidden` by default.
        ---
        There are three types of Display Logic rules you can choose from:
        ---
        **Type 1: IF The response to the question...**
        Then the Display Logic rules follow the following format:
        - **IF response to** pick the question from a dropdown list
        - **is**/ **is not** pick a choice from the dropdown list
        - **THEN section is Visible** 
        - **Default visibility** pick either **Visible** or **Hidden**. If Visible is selected, then section will be shown by default unless the Display Logic rule is triggered. If Hidden is selected, the section will be hidden by default unless the Display Logic rule is triggered.
        !!! example "Example 1"
            ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_displaylogic](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_displaylogic.png)
            In the example, if a user chooses a choice "Oily all over" in Question 4 "SKIN TYPE" then this section will be visible. If they give a different answer in Question 4 this content block will be hidden.
        ---
        **Type 2: IF The score of the variable...**
        Then the Display Logic rules follow the following format:
        - **IF The score of the variable** 
        - **score** pick the variable from a dropdown list
        - **is equal to**/ **is not equal to** / **is greater than**/ **is less than** / **is greater than or equal to** / **is less than or equal to** pick a choice from the dropdown list
        - **Number** / **Another variable** pick a choice from the dropdown list
        - **0** / **1** / **2** / **other numerical value** type a value in the input field
        - **THEN section is Visible** 
        - **Default visibility** pick either **Visible** or **Hidden**. If Visible is selected, then section will be shown by default unless the Display Logic rule is triggered. If Hidden is selected, the section will be hidden by default unless the Display Logic rule is triggered.
        !!! info
            Note: Scores are assigned to each choice in the [Questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions) tab > [Choice settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings) section.
        !!! example "Example 2"
            ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_displaylogic_scorerange](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_displaylogic_scorerange.png)
            In the example, if the score of the variable `dry` is greater than or equal to number `5` AND IF the score of the varaible `dry` is less than or equal to number `7` then this section will be visible. Otherwise, the section will be hidden.
        ---
        **Type 3: IF the variable with the highest score...**
        Then the Display Logic rules follow the following format:
        - **IF the variable with the highest score** 
        - **score** pick the variable from a dropdown list
        - **THEN section is Visible**
        - **Default visibility** pick either **Visible** or **Hidden**. If Visible is selected, then section will be shown by default unless the Display Logic rule is triggered. If Hidden is selected, the section will be hidden by default unless the Display Logic rule is triggered.
        !!! info
            Note: Scores are assigned to each choice in the [Questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions) tab > [Choice settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings) section.
        !!! example "Example 3"
            ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_displaylogic_winningvaraible](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_displaylogic_winningvaraible.png)
            In the example, if the variable with the highest score is `dry` then this section will be visible. Otherwise, the section will be hidden.
    5. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz. Test the quiz by clicking the `Preview` button and selecting different answers and checking if the correct content blocks are displayed.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ImHVs7AT8YY?si=iMGaCLXqTpr8yS0B" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    ![how to hide content with logic skip logic](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_skip_logic_flow.png)
    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add a `Multiple choice question` asking the customer about their skin type: Dry, Normal, Oily, or Combination-type skin. 
        !!! tip
            Use the [images or text blocks](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) to help customers determine their skin type.
    2. **Create Statement Questions**: Add multiple `Statement` slides describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:
        !!! example
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness ‚Äì we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that‚Äôs deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn‚Äôt experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin‚Äôs natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
    3. **Add Skip Logic**: If we don‚Äôt add skip logic to the quiz, our statement questions will just appear one after the other, regardless of the choice we made. 
        To add [skip logic](/how-to-guides/use-skip-logic/), you should go the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab and select the quesiton that should be skipped.  
        Next, in the right-hand menu locte the `Skip Logic` section.
        Click `+ Add another rule (OR)` to add a skip logic rule to the selected statement slide. 
        For example:
        ![how to hide content with logic shopifyv2 skip logic rule](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_skip_logic_rule.png)
        If the response for Question 4 **is not** "Dry and tight all over" then this question will be skipped. Meaning that if any other answer than "Dry and thight all over" is selected, then this question will be skipped.
        Use similar skip logic rules on the other statements to ensure that only relevant statement questions appear based on the customer's skin type selection.
    4. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz.

    !!! note
        Google Analytics GA4 tracking works best if you embed your quiz on a new page in your online store. Follow the instuctions in [this article](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-inline/#embedding-an-inline-quiz-on-a-new-page) to set this up.
    1. Make sure you have set up the GA4 tracking on your website. 
        !!! tip
            Don't know how to connect your website to Google Analytics or find your GA tracking code? [Check this link](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080).
    1. Head to your quiz and click on the [Integrations](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab.
    2. Click on the `Activate` button in the Google Analytics section.
        ![how to integrate ga4 built for shopify revenuehunt app](/images/how_to_integrate_ga4_shopify_v2.png)
    3. Click `Save` to confirm the changes.
    4. Once activated the quiz will connect to the GA4 tracking code already present on your website. It can take up to 72 hours for the data to start appearing in your Meta portal.
    ??? tip "Optional: Add Custom Trackers"
        If you want you can add custom trackers to your quiz to track specific events and user interactions. This is useful if you want to track events that are not covered by the default tracking.
        To implement custom event tracking for your quiz, follow these steps:
        1. **Understand the Callback Function**: Visit the [FAQ page](/how-to-guides/use-callback-function/) to learn how our callback function works and how it can be used for tracking custom events.
        2. **Embed the Custom Script**: Add the following script to your store's theme where the quiz is featured (preferably sitewide in your theme's main template file):
            ```html
            <script>
            function prqQuizCallback(quizResponse){
                gtag('event', 'your_event_name', {
                'event_category': 'quiz',
                'event_label': 'specific_label',
                'value': quizResponse.someValue
                });
            }
            </script>
            ``` 
        3. **Customize Event Tracking**: Modify the script with appropriate event names, labels, and values to track specific user actions. For example:
            ```html
            <script>
            function prqQuizCallback(quizResponse){
                // Track quiz start
                if(quizResponse.type === 'quiz_started') {
                    gtag('event', 'quiz_start', {
                        'event_category': 'quiz',
                        'event_label': quizResponse.quizName
                    });
                }
                // Track question answers
                if(quizResponse.type === 'question_answered') {
                    gtag('event', 'question_answer', {
                        'event_category': 'quiz',
                        'event_label': quizResponse.questionTitle,
                        'value': quizResponse.answer
                    });
                }
                // Track quiz completion
                if(quizResponse.type === 'quiz_completed') {
                    gtag('event', 'quiz_complete', {
                        'event_category': 'quiz',
                        'event_label': quizResponse.quizName
                    });
                }
            }
            </script>
            ```
        4. **Monitor and Adjust**: Once implemented, regularly check your Google Analytics dashboard to ensure events are being tracked correctly. Adjust the tracking code as needed based on your specific requirements.
    You'll be able to see quiz usage and customer behavior in your Google Analytics dashboard, under `Reports > View user engagement and retention > Events`.
    ![how to ga events](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_events.png)
    !!! warning "Data may take up to 72 hours to appear"
        If you don't see the events, check the `View realtime` tab in GA4 or wait a day or two for the data to appear. Google Analytics can take up to 72 hours to process the data.
    Events are triggered every time a customer starts a quiz, views a question, picks a choice, gets to the results page, adds a product to the cart, and proceeds to the cart/checkout. You can check more data about unique events by clicking on the specific Event name.
    | Trigger                                                             | Event Name | Event Parameters    |
    |---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------|

    | Customer proceeds to cart/checkout                                  | proceed_to_checkout_{quiz_name} | quiz_name |
    | Customer retakes quiz                                               | retake_quiz_{quiz_name} | quiz_name |
    GA4 doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúautomatically‚Äù tie custom events to purchases. But you can segment/filter by those events and then look at purchase revenue. 
    Here are some options:
    ### Option 1 - Create Free Form Exploration
    You can measure how much revenue your quiz generates directly in GA4 using an **Exploration**. This walkthrough shows how to build a Free form table comparing **quiz users** with **all users**.
    ![how to ga revenue](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_ga4_exploration1revenue1.png)
    ![how to ga revenue](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_ga4_exploration1revenue2.png)
    1. Go to `Explore ‚Üí + ‚Üí Free form`.
    2. **Create the ‚ÄúQuiz Users‚Äù segment**. In the Variables panel, under Segments, click +. Choose User segment. Set the condition: Include users where `Event name` ‚Üí `contains` ‚Üí `quiz_started` (or use `matches regex` ‚Üí `^quiz_started_.*$`). Name it `Quiz Users` ‚Üí `Save and apply`. Also add the default `All Users` segment for comparison.
    3. **Add Dimensions and Metrics**. In the Variables panel:
        - `Dimensions` ‚Üí `+` ‚Üí add: `Event name`
        - `Metrics` ‚Üí `+` ‚Üí add: `Event count`, `Purchases`, `Total revenue`
    4. **Configure the Tab Settings**. In the Tab Settings panel:
        - `Segments`: select `All Users` and `Quiz Users`
        - `Rows`: `Event name`
        - `Columns`: leave empty, or set to `Segment` for side-by-side comparison
        - `Values`: `Event count`, `Purchases`, `Total revenue`
        - `Filters`: `Event name contains quiz_started`
        - `Visualization`: `Table` (or Bar chart)
        - `Date range`: e.g. `Last 28 days`
        You‚Äôll now see a table showing revenue and purchases from quiz users (people who triggered a quiz_started event) compared to all users.
    5. **Save and Reuse**. Rename your exploration (e.g. `Quiz Revenue`). Use the star or share option so teammates can find it easily.
        !!! tip "Optional Variations"
            - Compare specific quizzes: Use `Filters` ‚Üí `Event name` contains your quiz ID/text  
                (e.g., `quiz_started_skincare_quiz_usa`).
            - If your quiz is on a dedicated page: Create a **Session/User segment**: include users where **Page location contains `/pages/skin-quiz`**.
                This shows revenue for anyone visiting that quiz page.
    ### Option 2 ‚Äì Attribution via Source/Medium
    If you‚Äôre tagging quiz entry points with UTM parameters (like `utm_source=quiz` or `utm_campaign=quiz_name`), GA4‚Äôs `Advertising ‚Üí Attribution ‚Üí Model comparison` will show revenue attributed to those.
    You'll see revenue attributed to the quiz in `Engagement > Conversions > Event name > purchase`. Click on the `purchase` event.
    ![how to ga revenue2](/images/how_to_ga_revenue2.png)
    Add a `Source` column next to the default channel grouping and look for the rows which include the `revenuehunt` source.
    ![how to ga events](/images/how_to_ga_events.png)
    Google Analytics 4 (GA4) offers **Explorations**, a powerful tool for digging deeper into your quiz data. Standard reports show you high-level trends, but Explorations let you ask more specific questions about how customers interact with your quiz and how it impacts revenue.
    With Explorations, you can:
    - **Compare quiz users vs. all users**. See how much revenue is generated by customers who start a quiz compared to those who don‚Äôt.
    - **Break down results by quiz**. If you run multiple quizzes, use Explorations to see which quiz names bring in the most purchases and revenue.
    - **Build funnels**. Visualize the full journey from *quiz\_started* ‚Üí *results\_page\_viewed* ‚Üí *product\_added\_to\_cart* ‚Üí *purchase*, and spot where users drop off.
    - **Analyze user paths**. Discover what customers do after completing your quiz‚Äîdo they view recommended products, add to cart, or head straight to checkout?
    - **Create segments and audiences**. Build an audience of ‚ÄúQuiz Users‚Äù for ongoing analysis or remarketing in Google Ads.
    Refer to the Google Analytics [documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7579450?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article) for more information on how to use GA4 Explorations.
    ### Example 1: Most Clicked Choices
    You can build an exploration to see which choices are most popular.
    ![how to ga exploration](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_ga4_exploration2choices.png)
    1. Go to `Explore ‚Üí + ‚Üí Free form`.
    2. Add Dimensions and Metrics. In the Variables panel:
        - `Dimensions` ‚Üí `+` ‚Üí add: `Event name`
        - `Metrics` ‚Üí `+` ‚Üí add: `Event count`  
    3. Configure the Tab Settings. In the Tab Settings panel:
        - `Segments`: select `All Users` (or add `Quiz Users` if you want to limit results to quiz participants)
        - `Rows`: `Event name`
        - `Columns`: leave empty
        - `Values`: `Event count`
        - `Filters`: `Event name contains block_answered`
        - `Visualization`: `Table` (or Bar chart)
        - `Date range`: e.g. `Last 28 days`
        You‚Äôll now see a table showing which quiz answers (`block_answered` events) were clicked most often, giving you a clear view of the most popular choices.
    5. **Save and Reuse**. Rename your exploration (e.g. `Most Clicked Choices`). Use the star or share option so teammates can find it easily.
    ### Example 2: Track Revenue from Quizzes
    You can measure how much revenue your quiz generates directly in GA4 using an **Exploration**. This walkthrough shows how to build a Free form table comparing **quiz users** with **all users**.
    ![how to ga revenue](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_ga4_exploration1revenue1.png)
    ![how to ga revenue](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_ga4_exploration1revenue2.png)
    1. Go to `Explore ‚Üí + ‚Üí Free form`.
    2. **Create the ‚ÄúQuiz Users‚Äù segment**. In the Variables panel, under Segments, click +. Choose User segment. Set the condition: Include users where `Event name` ‚Üí `contains` ‚Üí `quiz_started` (or use `matches regex` ‚Üí `^quiz_started_.*$`). Name it `Quiz Users` ‚Üí `Save and apply`. Also add the default `All Users` segment for comparison.
    3. **Add Dimensions and Metrics**. In the Variables panel:
        - `Dimensions` ‚Üí `+` ‚Üí add: `Event name`
        - `Metrics` ‚Üí `+` ‚Üí add: `Event count`, `Purchases`, `Total revenue`
    4. **Configure the Tab Settings**. In the Tab Settings panel:
        - `Segments`: select `All Users` and `Quiz Users`
        - `Rows`: `Event name`
        - `Columns`: leave empty, or set to `Segment` for side-by-side comparison

# How to Integrate Meta Pixel with Quiz

The Meta Pixel is an essential analytics tool for tracking user interaction with your quiz and gauging the success of your Facebook ads.

This article explains how to integrate the Meta Pixel with your quiz application and how to use the Meta Events Manager to track user interactions with your quiz.

??? question "What is Meta Pixel?"

    This small piece of code placed on your website helps you monitor conversions from ads, improve the performance of future advertising, and create targeted audiences based on past interactions with your website.

## Setting Up Your Meta Pixel

!!! note

    Facebook Pixel / Meta Pixel tracking works best if you embed your quiz on a new page in your online store. Follow the instuctions in [this article](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-inline/#embedding-an-inline-quiz-on-a-new-page) to set this up.

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/3257be8755f044969f803d9e5d29ace6?sid=8a6b4ed5-3bfe-4935-b820-9573ed93ce98" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    If you have not implemented a Pixel on your website yet, set one up following [Meta guide](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/952192354843755?id=1205376682832142). Once created, add it to your website.
    1. **Connect Meta Pixel to your Shopify Store**: Navigate to your Shopify `Store settings > Customer events`. Ensure that the Meta (Facebook) Pixel is integrated. If not, use the [Facebook and Instagram Meta app](https://apps.shopify.com/facebook-and-instagram-meta-app) for integration.
    2. **Set Up Data Sources**: Open the Facebook and Instagram app in Shopify. Go to `settings` and set `shared data` to `maximum` to track advanced and custom events. Choose or create a **data set** for tracking. 
        ![how to integrate fb pixel built for shopify revenuehunt app](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_integrate_meta_pixel_facebookappsettings.png)
        !!! tip
            To create a new data set, go to [https://business.facebook.com/](https://business.facebook.com/) > `Ads Manager` > `Events Manager` > `Data sources` > `Create data source`.
    3. **Publish the Quiz**: Ensure the quiz is published on your online store. It is recommended to have a dedicated page for the quiz to track events accurately.
        !!! tip
            Check this article to learn how to publish the quiz on a dedicated landing page: [Publish Quiz Inline](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-inline/#embedding-an-inline-quiz-on-a-new-page)
    4. **Connect Quiz to Meta Pixel**: To integrate the Meta Pixel with your quiz:
        - Go to the [Integrations](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab within your quiz settings.
        - Find the Meta Pixel section and hit `Activate`.
            ![how to integrate fb pixel built for shopify revenuehunt app](/images/how_to_integrate_fb_pixel_shopify_v2.png)
        - Click `Save` to confirm the changes.
        - Once activated the quiz will connect to the Meta Pixel already present on your website.
    4. **Test the Integration**: In Shopify admin, go to Facebook and Instagram app > `settings`, and open the data set to access Meta Events Manager. Use the `Test events` feature to confirm that events are being tracked correctly by interacting with the quiz. Provide your website URL to test the integration. Then navigate to your website and interact with the quiz. After completing the quiz, check the Events Manager for tracked events such as: 
        - Retake quiz
        - View content page
        - Lead submissions (name and email)
        If events are visible, the pixel integration is functioning correctly.
        ![how to integrate fb pixel built for shopify revenuehunt app](https://loom.com/i/da1d0cdd420341698d56384c34496a99?workflows_screenshot=true)
        For a complete list of tracked events within the Revenue Hunt app, check the [Tracked Events](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/#tracked-events) section.
    6. **Review Custom Events**: If you want to use the custom events in your ads and audiences, you need to review them. Check the [Review Custom Events](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/#review-custom-events) section.
    For an alternative approach to tracking user interactions, consider implementing custom JavaScript to measure specific events on your site. By incorporating our [callback function](/how-to-guides/use-callback-function/), you have the capability to manually trigger or log events based on user actions.
    To deploy this method, you can insert a script within the theme of your store's page, especially where a quiz is featured. Follow these steps:
    1. **Deactivate Meta Pixel**: If you have previously connected a pixel through the [Connect](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab, you'll have to deactivate it and publish the changes.
    2. **Embed the Custom Script**: Insert the following script into the theme of your store‚Äôs page where the quiz or the event you want to track is located (load it sitewide and put it into the theme.liquid):
        ```html
        <script>
        function prqQuizCallback(quizResponse){
            window.fbq(action, event, params);
        }
        </script>
        ```
    3. **Customize Your Event Tracking**: In the script, replace the values with the appropriate event name, action, and params that you wish to track. This customization allows you to monitor specific user actions on your website.
    4. **Monitor and Adjust**: After the script is active and events are being tracked, regularly monitor the data to ensure everything is working as intended. Be prepared to make adjustments to the script or event definitions as needed.

# How to Fix Product Images Not Showing

This guide explains how to fix product images not showing in your quiz.

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

Product or Collection images are displayed directly from your Shopify catalog. If you don't see product images, please check your Shopify Products/Collections.

================================================================================

# How to Only Recommend Products with X Votes or More

It is possible to limit the number of recommended products on the results page by only showing products that received X votes or more (a certain minimum number of votes). This allows you to filter the quiz recommendations and only show the real winners. 

To activate this setting in your quiz follow the instructions below.

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

1. Make sure that you have a **Product Block** or a **Product Slot Block** that recommends products on your [results page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/). 
    2. Make sure you understand how our [recommendations algorithm](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/) works.
        ??? question "How do I get the right recommendations?"
            Our product recommendation algorithm works like a voting system:
            - Products are linked to each choice
            - When a customer picks a choice, all linked products receive one vote
            - After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted products sorted by the number of votes
            - If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty
            - If there's a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the order of products.
    2. To activate the `Minimum nuber of votes` setting navigate to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/).
    2. Open the [Product Block Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#block-settings).
    3. Scroll down to find the `Minimum number of votes` setting.

        1. Publish the quiz on a new page in Shopify by following the instructions on [How to Publish the Quiz on a New Page in Shopify](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-inline/#embedding-an-inline-quiz-on-a-dedicated-landing-page).
        2. Open the PageFly editor and create a new page or open an existing page.
        3. In the page builder, go to `Elements` and add a `Button` element to your page by draggin it.
        4. In Button settings, under Action select `Go to URL` and enter the URL of the page where the quiz is embeded.
            ![Button Settings](/images/how_to_pagefly_addbutton.png)

# How to Set Up Automatic Popups

This guide walks you through setting up automatic popups on your eCommerce store, including popups that appear based on time spent on a page, across all pages, on the homepage, with exit intent, and options for showing popups multiple times per session.

!!! info "What's an Automatic Popup?"
    It's a quiz popup that appears after X seconds. The popup is shown only once per session unless `Exit Intent` option is enabled in the popup settings. Automatic popups can significantly enhance user engagement by presenting timely content or interactive elements like quizzes. 

!!! warning

    Automatic popups can be very intrusive which is why, by default, they are shown only once per customer session.

!!! note "Before you start"

    Before you start ensure you have a quiz created with the RevenueHunt app, access to the theme editor and (optional) basic understanding of HTML for editing themes.

    *Note: Directly editing your Shopify or other eCommerce theme's source code can potentially disrupt your store's functionality. If unsure about some steps, consider hiring a developer.*

## Auto-Popup on the Main Page

!!! info "What's an Automatic Popup Quiz on the Main Page?"
    It's a quiz popup that appears after X seconds on the main page of your store. The popup is shown only once per session unless `Exit Intent` option is enabled in the popup settings.

# How to Set Up a Quiz Link Popup on Your Store

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a **Quiz Link Popup** on your eCommerce store. 

!!! info "What's a Link Popup?"

    Link Popup allows your customers to access a quiz through a popup by clicking on a link within your site's navigation menu, a button, a banner or any page or blog post. It's a great way to engage visitors and collect valuable data.


!!! note 
    Before you start, ensure you have a quiz created and the necessary permissions to edit themes, pages and navigation settings

    - Use `#quiz` as the link in the navigation menu item, a button, a banner or any page or blog post to open the quiz as a popup.
    Link popup can be opened on every page (activate `Link Popup Quiz` in `App Embeds`) or on a specific page (add a `Link Popup Quiz` section to a page template) in your store.

    1. Go to your Shopify admin dashboard and navigate to `Online Store > Themes > Customize`.
    2. Within theme customization, go to `App Embeds` and find the `Link Popup Quiz` settings.
    3. Look for the z-index setting and increase the value (try with 1000 first, if that doesn't work, try 10000).
    4. Save your changes.
    ![z-index setting in V2 Link Popup](/images/how_to_publish_quiz_link_popup_zindex_setting.png)
    !!! note
        Setting the z-index too high might hide other elements like chat buttons. The ideal setting will depend on your specific theme's configuration.
    If adjusting the z-index setting doesn't solve the issue, try to **publish the quiz inline with a page instead.** Check the instructions [here](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-inline/#embedding-an-inline-quiz-on-a-new-page).

    3. **Create Your Link**: Use the format `#quiz-QUIZID` for your link. For example, if your quiz ID is "DmHLGj", your link would be `#quiz-DmHLGj`.
    4. **Add the Link**: Follow the same steps as described earlier for adding a link to a menu item or button, but use your specific quiz link instead of just `#quiz`.
    **Example use cases:**
    - Different quizzes for different product categories (e.g., "#quiz-ABC123" for skincare quiz, "#quiz-XYZ789" for makeup quiz)
    - A/B testing different quiz versions
    - Seasonal or promotional quizzes alongside your main quiz
    !!! example "Example"
        `https://yourstore.myshopify.com/#quiz-123` can open one quiz, while  `https://yourstore.myshopify.com/#quiz-456` can open another. 
        To find your Quiz ID, go to the [dashboard](/reference/dashboard/) and identify a quiz. Click on the `...` and copy the ID.
    !!! warning
        Don't add the full URL into the `Link` filed. It should only contain the `#quiz-QUIZID` text and **not** a full URL like `http://yourwebsite.com/#quiz-QUIZID`.
    !!! warning "Shopify 1.0 Theme Compatibility"
        Quizzes created with the `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app cannot be published on Shopify 1.0 themes.

App embeds are a feature available in Online Store 2.0 themes, which allow you to add app functionality without touching any code. If you want to use app embeds, you would need to upgrade to an Online Store 2.0 theme.
    If you see the error message "The quiz you are looking for does not exist" when trying to link to a quiz, follow these steps:
    1. Ensure that you have activated the `Link Popup Quiz` in the  Online Store > Theme > Customize > `App Embeds` section and **not** the the legacy `Link Popup Quiz Legacy`.
        ![docs/images/how_to_publish_shipifyV2_V1publisherrorlinkpopup.png](/images/how_to_publish_shipifyV2_V1publisherrorlinkpopup.png)
        If a wrong link popup is activated, you will see the error message "The quiz you are looking for does not exist" when trying to link to a V2 quiz. 
        To solve this simply deactivate the `Link Popup Legacy` and activate the `Link Popup Quiz` one. Then, save the changes.
    2. Verify that the link is correctly formatted. Ensure that the link you've added to your menu or a button is correctly formatted and it follows the format `#quiz`.

    This means that your product matrix looks something like this:
    | Age/Skin type   | Dry or Normal                                                                                                                                                 | Oily                                                                                                                                                                  |

    You can start building your quiz. 
    1. **Add new quiz**: Go to the RevenueHunt app and click on `+ Add new quiz`. 
    2. **Name the quiz**: Name the quiz and you‚Äôll be directed to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/).
    3. **Add questions**: Based on the above table, two questions will be necessary to determine the right product for the customer. 
        - The first question is about the client‚Äôs age.
        ![how to recommend products matrix question1](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_recommend_product_matrix_question1.png)
        - The second question is about client‚Äôs skin type.
        ![how to recommend products matrix question2](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_recommend_product_matrix_question2.png)
    You should upvote the collections created in [Step 2](#step-2-create-collections) to the choices in the quiz. 
    1. **Open Choice Settings**: To do that, navigate to the [Questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) tab in the Quiz Builder and click on a choice to open the [Choice Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings).
    2. **Upvote Collections**: In Choice settings, find the `Upvote` button and select `Collections` from the dropdown.
    3. For each choice find a collection to be added from your catalog and add it to the choice.
        ![how to recommend products matrix link collections](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_recommend_product_matrix_upvotecollections.png)
    For the products to show on the Results Page, you need to add a `Products Block`. 
    1. **Go to the Results Page tab**: You can do that by navigating to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/).
    2. **Add a Product Block**:  Clicking the `+ Add block` to add a block type. Slect a `Product Block` from the dropdown list.
    3. **Limit the number of recommended products**: In this example, we should limit the amount of recommended products to 4 (based on the matrix). To limit the number of recommended products shown open the [`Product Block settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections) and select how many products should be recommended in this Product Block from the dropdown.
    If your product Matrix looks more like a list, there is another way to achieve your precise product recommendations.  Let‚Äôs look at the matrix below. 
    ![how to recommend products complex matrix](/images/how_to_recommend_products_complexmatrix.png)
    The outcome of the quiz depends on 3 factors: skin type, age, and skin concern. In each case, the products recommended differing.
    For this complex matrix, creating separate collections for each outcome is possible, but there‚Äôs also an **alternative**.
    What you can do instead is to pick one of the factors and create branching in the quiz with [Jump Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic). This will allow you to show the customer the same questions but link different products to each branch, therefore resulting in different outcomes.
    Here‚Äôs an example of a Conditional Logic tree for the Matrix above where Skin Type was chosen as a branchign factor:
    ![how to recommend products complex matrix logic tree](/images/how_to_recommend_products_complexmatrix_logictree.png)
    !!! tip

# How to Recommend Products Based on Number of User Choices

??? question "Do I need advanced technical skills to set this up?"

    While the process isn‚Äôt entirely plug-and-play, with the assistance of a developer, it‚Äôs manageable. If you‚Äôre not familiar with JavaScript or CSS, seeking developer help is advisable.

## How do I recommend products based on the number of user choices?

The recommendation process is based on how many choices the user selects out of the given set. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide:

1. **Create collections/categories**. Create distinct collections for each group of products you wish to recommend, e.g., ‚Äú1/10 choices selected,‚Äù ‚Äú2/10 choices selected,‚Äù etc.
2. **Add hidden choices**. In your final question, include a multiple-choice option that correlates with the aforementioned collections/categories. This ensures that each choice connects to its respective recommended collection/category. Make sure to hide these choices from the user with custom CSS code.
3. **Add custom JavaScript**. Using custom JavaScript, evaluate the choices selected throughout the quiz and write a piece of code that automatically selects one of the hidden choices in the last question. This will determine which product collection/category to recommend based on the number of choices the user made.

## How can I ensure that users don‚Äôt see the choices in the last question?

You can hide these technical choices in the last question using custom CSS code. A guide on how to customize the quiz design can be found [here](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/).

## Where do I input the custom JavaScript code?

[This article](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) explains how to add custom JavaScript code to quiz questions. For example:

![recommend-products-based-on-number-of-user-choices image1](/images/recommend-products-based-on-number-of-user-choices_image1.png)

The custom JavaScript code should be integrated into the final question to assess the user‚Äôs choices and click the right choices in order to recommend a product collection accordingly.

## How can I identify the selected choices from each slide or question with JavaScript?

To review the values or choice IDs selected for each slide/question, you can use the JavaScript console and search for the values:

![recommend-products-based-on-number-of-user-choices image2](/images/recommend-products-based-on-number-of-user-choices_image2.png)

---
This guide provides information on how to set up a custom solution that will recommend products based on the number of user choices.

# How to Recommend Products Based on Numerical Inputs

Recommending products based on numerical answers (like age or room size) can be tricky if you use open-ended input fields. This guide will show you how to structure these questions in your quiz to trigger tailored recommendations using finite answer choices.

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 53.125%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/6bcdb3d771c74d49adb72a56910ba07f?sid=6b9950ee-7ef5-4483-8af4-6c14f32f87c7" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    Open-ended numerical questions like [Number](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#number) or [Date](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#date) allow users to enter any value ‚Äî but that flexibility comes with a cost: **you can't directly link recommendations to those answers**. To deliver accurate product suggestions, you'll need a structured approach.
    ![open-ended numerical question](https://loom.com/i/934b3a724c0346829baf78e6261f22e4?workflows_screenshot=true)
    Questions like "What's your age?", "What's your birth date?" or "How big is your room?" might seem useful, but since users can input any number, you can't associate specific product recommendations with those responses.
    To make recommendations work, **use multiple choice or dropdown questions**. Instead of asking for a number, offer predefined numbers or ranges.
    !!! example "Example - Age Ranges"
        Change "What's your age?" from an input field to a dropdown with:
        - Under 20
        - 21‚Äì30
        - 31‚Äì40
        - Over 40
        This lets you assign relevant products to each range.
        ![use dropdown question to ask age ranges](https://loom.com/i/7606561efb5a4012860717b5ec6a468f?workflows_screenshot=true)
    !!! example "Example - Year of Birth"
        Change "What's your year of birth?" from an input field to a dropdown with:
        - 1990
        - 1991
        - 1992
        - 1993
        - 1994
        - 1995
        - 1996
        This lets you assign relevant products to each year.
        ![use dropdown question to ask year of birth](/images/how_to_recommend_products_based_on_numerical_inputs_shopify_yearbirthquestion_dropdown.png) 
    Once you switch to finite answers, you can:
    - [Upvote](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) specific products, variants or collections to each choice
    - Set up [Jump Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) or [Display logic](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#display-logic-display-section-logic) based on the user's choices
    This is how to make sure that the product recommendation logic works in your quiz.
    !!! tip "Use Quiz Co-Pilot to Help"
        If you‚Äôre working with broader questions like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your room size?‚Äù, use Quiz Co-Pilot to break it down into more useful options. It can suggest follow-up questions or ranges without you having to write them all manually.
        !!! example "Example - Room Size Ranges"
            Create a dropdown for room sizes like:
            - Less than 50 sqft
            - 51‚Äì100 sqft
            - 101‚Äì150 sqft
            - More than 150 sqft
            Quiz Co-Pilot can generate these for you automatically and help match them to recommendations.
            ![use quiz copilot to generate room size ranges](https://loom.com/i/8f81da1d43544435a45e5709b01fb436?workflows_screenshot=true)
    After generating options, you can:
    - Switch between question types (dropdown, multiple choice, etc.) via [Block Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings)
    - Tweak the answer labels in [Choice Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings)
    - Assign products to each choice via the [Choice Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings)
    - Set up [Jump Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) or [Display logic](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#display-logic-display-section-logic) based on the user's choices
    This helps users select a range easily while ensuring you offer relevant products.
    RevenueHunt Quizzes currently doesn't have a feature that would allow custom result calculations based on numerical user input.
    If you're building a quiz that requires custom calculations based on a precise numerical user input, for example a BMI calculation or dosage calculation, your developer can use the [Custom JavaScript](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) feature to add custom logic to your quiz results page. This approach involves accessing the quiz answers via the `console.log()` on the results page, programing custom behaviors on the result page with JavaScript and printing an output onto an HTML element. 
    In our [JavaScript guide](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) we provide an example of adding a [BMI calculator](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/#example-2-insert-calculations) to your results page.

# How to Recommend Products

Our solution takes into account your customer's choices to offer highly personalized product recommendations. 

This guide explains how to recommend products with the RevenueHunt app, the underlying algorithm and proposes solutions for complex quizzes.

## Recommendations

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz can show on the results page **product variants**, **main products** and **collections**.
    If you add a Block to your results page, you can choose to display **product variants**, **main products** or **collections** under [Block Settings > Recommendations Type](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections). 
    - If you chose a **Products** under Recommendations Type, the Slot will show the main product with a optional dropdown to choose the specific variant. The order in which the product variants are displayed is based on the number of votes they received. If all varaints of the same product received the same number of votes, the variants will be displayed in random order.
    - If you chose a **Product Varaints** under Recommendations Type, the Slot will show recommended variants of a product with the full name of a product followed by the varaint name, for example "Toner - 100ml". 
        !!! note
            It is not possible to display the variants in a dropdown with this option, because it's meant to lead the user to the specific variant of a product. If you want to display the variants in a dropdown, you can use a **Products** option instead.
    - If you chose a **Collections** under Recommendations Type, the Slot will show the recommended a specific collection from your Shopify store. 
        !!! note
            If your recommended collections doesn't show any image, it's likely becuase you have not yet added an image to the collection in your Shopify > Products > Collections section. Once you add an image, the collection will show the image on the results page.
    In the `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app, there are several ways to recommend products:
    **‚úçüèª Option 1: Recommend Most Voted Products**
    *Best for most quizzes.*
    ![how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_funnel](/images/how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_funnel.png){width="300"}
    - Link products or collections to each quiz choice.
    - On the results page, add a product block that displays the most voted items.
    - You can show multiple product slots to recommend a routine or bundle.
    !!! note
        Follow [this guide](/how-to-guides/set-up-funnel-quiz/) to learn how to set up this option.
    **üéØ Option 2: Use Scoring or Variables**
    *Best for personality-style quizzes.*
    ![how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_winningvariable](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_scoringquiz_varaiblequiz.png){width="300"}
    - Assign a score or custom variable to each choice in the quiz.
    - Set up result sections with fixed recommendations for each type of outcome.
    - Use display logic to show the right section based on the score or variable with the highest value.
    - **Example:** Show Section A if the top variable is "blue", Section B if it‚Äôs "red".
    !!! note   
        Follow [this guide](/how-to-guides/set-up-scoring-quiz/) to learn how to set up this option.
    **üß© Option 3: Use Complex Display Logic**
    *Best for advanced logic or detailed recommendation matrices.*
    ![how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_displaylogic](/images/how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_displaylogic.png){width="300"}
    - Create logic-based paths that lead users to different result pages.
    - Or use one results page with multiple sections and display logic for each.
    - Show/hide each section depending on the customer‚Äôs answers.
    !!! note
        Follow [this guide](/how-to-guides/set-up-fixed-recommendations-quiz/) to learn how to set up this option.
    ![how_to_recommend_products_decision_tree_V2](/images/how_to_recommend_products_decision_tree_V2.png)

# How to Recommend a Skincare Routine with Slots

With RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz, it is possible to group products into slots and recommend a product for each step in a beauty routine.

This guide is designed to help merchants effectively use [Product Slot Blocks](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#block-types) on the results page to organize product recommendations.

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 74.27785419532324%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/f249d672fe414dc390715b210a94a75a?sid=0a795570-01c5-4777-b6b1-62b0a0da3387" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    To group products into slots, you‚Äôll need to create new collections in your Shopify store. These collections will be used to group your products on the results page.
    1. **Identify Product Categories**: Determine your skincare product categories (e.g., Cleansers, Toners, Serums, Moisturizers).
    2. **Create Collections**: For each category, [create a collection in your Shopify store](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/collections) with the right products. Each collection should only contain products relevant to its category. For example, 
        - a *Cleansers* collection should have all the cleansing products, a *Toners* collection should have all the toning products, 
        - a *Serums* collection should have all the serums, etc. 
        - You can have more than one collection that includes some of the same products.
        ![how to recommend slots cleansers collection](/images/how_to_recommend_slots_cleansers_collection.png)
    1. **Go to Link Products/Collections tab**: To add link products or product variants to choices, go to [Questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/), select a multiple-choice question, then a choice and open the [Choice Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings).
        ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_upvotecollections](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_upvotecollections.png)
    2. **Link Products**: Link all relevant product variants or collections to each choice. Ensure every choice in your quiz is linked to at least one product or collection to prevent empty results. If a product does not recieve at least one vote, it will never show up on the results page.
        ![how to recommend slots link products](/images/how_to_recommend_slots_shopify_v2_link_products.png)
    1. **Edit the Results Page**: Go to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) tab and edit the content. Add design elements like headings, logos, and content blocks.
    2. **Add a Product Block**: Use the `+` button to add a `Product Block` to the Results Page.
    3. **Add Slots**: Open the [`Product Block settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) and add a slot for each step in the skincare routine. For example, if your routine consists of 4 products, you should add 4 slots to your Slots Block.
    4. **Edit the Slot**: You can add a title or a description to each slot.
    5. **Add Segments**: Add a segment with the corresponding product collection to each slot in the `Add segment` section. It's vital for displaying recommendations. Slot can only show most-voted products from a collection that's added in the segment field.
        ![how to recommend slots slot block](/images/how_to_shopifyV2_recommend_routine_with_slots.png)
    6. **Choose Product number**: In the [`Product Block settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) you can choose how many products should be recommended per each step. *Tip: Our most succseful quizzes recommend a single product per slot.*

# How to Recommend Subscription Products

This guide explains how to integrate and recommend subscription products with RevenueHunt app.

Recommending subscription products via the RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz can simplify your e-commerce strategy by providing a steady revenue stream and fostering long-term customer relationships. 

However, not all subscription apps are supported yet with the RevenueHunt app. Currently, we support [ReCharge Subscriptions](https://apps.shopify.com/subscription-payments?surface_intra_position=1&surface_type=partners&surface_version=redesign) for Shopify V1 (legacy version) and [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) for WooCommerce.

If you're using a subscription app that is not supported, you can still recommend subscription products to your users by sending them to a single-time payment product page from the quiz results using [this workaround](#other-subscriptions). This will allow your users to subscribe to the product from the product page.

![how to recommend subscription products sample product](/images/how_to_recommend_subscription_products_sample_product.png)


!!! warning

    RevenueHunt app currently only integrates with [ReCharge Subscriptions](https://apps.shopify.com/subscription-payments?surface_intra_position=1&surface_type=partners&surface_version=redesign) for Shopify V1 (legacy version) and [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) for WooCommerce. Subscription products are not yet supported in the Product Recommendation Quiz for Shopify (new version),BigCommerce or Magento. They will not show up on the Results page. However, there‚Äôs a workaround explained in the [Other subscriptions](#other-subscriptions) section of the article.

## ReCharge Subscriptions

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

1. To add subscription to your recommended products go to the [Results Page]().
    2. Find the [Product Block](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections) and open its settings.
    3. Under `Product components layout`, find the `Subscription` option and add it to the layout.
        ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_blocksettings_products_addblock](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_blocksettings_products_addblock.png)
    4. Under `Subscription`, select the subscription app you want to use.
        ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_blocksettings_productcomponents_subscription](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_blocksettings_productcomponents_subscription.png)

    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/d5f15461e3014d2fa8ad33637410d4ba?sid=ed6fdfff-9d0e-439b-aa83-a61708b36a44" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    For other subscription apps, there's a workaround that allows you to still guide your customers towards subscription options via the Product Reocommendation Quiz. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to implement this workaround effectively:
    **Step 1: Link One-Time Payment Products to Quiz Choices**
    1. Identify your subscription products that you wish to promote through the quiz.
    2. **Create one-time payment options**: Create equivalent one-time payment products for each of your subscription items. These will serve as placeholders in the quiz.
    3. **Link one-time payment products to chocies**: In the [Link Products](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) section, link each of these one-time payment products to the relevant quiz choices or set up [Fixed Recommendations](/how-to-guides/set-up-fixed-recommendations-quiz/#always-the-same-recommendations) on your Results Page. This ensures that when a customer selects an option that would traditionally lead to a subscription product, they are instead matched with the corresponding one-time payment product.
    **Step 2: Adjust Checkout Settings**
    1. **Open Results Page settings**: Navigate to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) and add or select a [Product Block](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections)
    2. **Change Product Components Layout**: In [Product Block settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections), find the [`Product Components Layout`](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#product-components-layout) section and remove the `Add to cart button option. Once removed, insert a `Link to Product` component instead.
        ![how_to_shopifyV2_recommend_subscriptions_workaround](/images/how_to_shopifyV2_recommend_subscriptions_workaround.png)
    As a result, the buyers will not be able to add the product to the cart directly from the quiz results page. Instead, they will be redirected to the product page where they can subscribe.

# How to Redirect Quiz to Another Page

In this guide, we'll explore several methods to redirect your customers to another page following the completion of a quiz. Below, you'll find detailed steps for implementing page redirection using various techniques within a quiz environment.

## Using Jump Logic for Conditional Redirection

[Jump Logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/) offers a dynamic way to direct customers to specific URLs based on their quiz interactions. Here's how to implement it:

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/312b3b8099174391abe9f5f17b6918bb?sid=2f2dc229-23be-418c-9c7a-ab66922c30f8" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    1. **Navigate to the Conditional Logic Section**: In the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/), locate the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab, select the last question in the quiz (or another question if you want to redirect the customer after a specific question). In the menu that opens, go the [`Jump Logic`](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) tab. 
    2. **Configure URL Redirection**: Specify the URL to which customers should be redirected to. This can be set to occur after a specific question or based on selected answers.
    	![how to redirect quiz ot another page jump logic](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogic_defaultdestination.png)
    3. **Publish & Test Your Setup**: Click the top-right `Publish/Save` button to update the preview/live quiz. Then, `Preview` the quiz to ensure the redirection wors correctly. 
    Even if you redirect the customer with Jump Logic to another page the quiz responses will be saved in the Quiz Builder's [`Metrics`](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) section.
    !!! warning
          The callback function is not supported in the `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app.
      The callback function is not supported in the `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app. However, the new quiz version's results page includes powerful features such as conditionally displaying sections based on quiz answers or custom scores, adding custom JavaScript, and showcasing fixed products. It also offers advanced layout and alignment options, allowing you to create a unique and fully customized results page‚Äîwithout needing to redirect users to an external page.
      Offering a direct link to another page from your [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) can be achieved simply with an **Button**.
      1. **Add a Button**: In the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) editor, click the `+ Add block` button to insert a `Button` block.
      2. **Insert the Button URL**: Use the Button URL field to add a custom link URL you want the user to be redirected to:
           ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_blocksettings_button](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_blocksettings_button.png)

# How to Restore Quiz Progress

Accidentally losing progress or facing unintended changes made by a colleague can be frustrating. Fortunately, if you find yourself in such a situation with your quiz, there is a way to recover a previous stable version of your Product Recommendation Quiz. 

This guide will walk you through the process of using the [Version History](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#version-history) feature to recover an earlier version of your quiz, ensuring your hard work isn't lost.

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/ed05fcf812244f7f965e180fd446ea94?sid=d6e9b2f1-62bd-40b6-bdfe-14a314cbb295" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    The [Version History](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#version-history) function allows you to browse through saved versions of your quiz, offering a safeguard against accidental loss or changes.
    1. **Go to Quiz Settings**: Look for the [Quiz Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/) option within the Quiz Builder or the Dashboard.
    2. **Find the Version History Tab**: Within the Quiz Settings, locate the [Version History](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#version-history) tab. Here, you'll see a list of the saved versions of your quiz.
    ![Built for Shopify revenuehunt app Version History](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizsettings_versionhistory.png)
    Version History does not track every minor edit. Instead, it captures a new version each time you save changes to your quiz with the top-right `Save` button. 
    - A new version is saved only when you click `Save` on your quiz. This action updates the preview/live quiz and records a version in the history. 
    - The interface uses colored `tags` to indicate where changes were made, such as to `questions` or `settings`, making it easier to identify the nature of each version. 
    - For better organization and clarity, you can click on `Show more details` to expand the version change details and see where exactly the changes were made.
    For recent changes, use the `undo` button `(Ctrl + Z)` to revert the last action.
    If multiple slides or questions are missing, follow the steps below to recover a previously published version.
    1. **Navigate to the Quiz Settings**: Go to the [Quiz Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/) page.
    2. **Go to the Version History Tab**: Within the Quiz Settings, locate the [Version History](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#version-history) tab. Here, you'll see a list of the saved versions of your quiz.
    3. **Click Show More Details**: Click on `Show More Details` to view specific changes made in each version. Note that each version is created when you save the quiz. Only saved changes are shown in the version history.
    4. **Select the Version**: Select the version corresponding to the date of the changes you want to recover.
    5. **Use the Three Dots Menu**: Click on the three dots next to the version to see options: `   Create a New Quiz` or `Restore This Version`.
        - `Create a New Quiz` generates a new quiz with a new ID, while 
        - `Restore This Version` replaces the current quiz with the selected version without changing the quiz ID.
        !!! tip
            If unsure about which version to restore, create a new quiz using the selected version to review its content.
    6. After creation, you will be taken to the quiz builder where you can verify the content of the new quiz.

# How to Send Leads to ActiveCampaign

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

While the new Built for Shopiify version of the RevenueHunt app **does not** yet integrate directly with ActiveCampaign, it is still possible to send quiz leads to ActiveCampaign.
    One option includes using our [Webhooks](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-webhooks/) integration to send quiz leads to ActiveCampaign. Another, includes manually adding the quiz leads to ActiveCampaign by uploading a CSV file generated from the quiz.
    This guide explain how you can send quiz data to ActiveCampaign with a workaround.
    It is **not yet possible** to link your Product Recommendation Quiz created in the new Built for Shopify version of the RevenueHunt app to ActiveCampaign.
    Check [Alternative Ways to Send Quiz Leads to ActiveCampaign](#alternative-ways-to-send-quiz-leads-to-activecampaign) to learn how you can send quiz leads to ActiveCampaign anyway.
    Sometimes, you would like a bit more control over the data that is sent to ActiveCampaign. In that case there are a few alternatives you can use to send quiz leads to ActiveCampaign.
    - **Using Webhooks**: You can use our Webhooks integration to send quiz leads to ActiveCampaign. Just connect your quiz to Webhooks following [this guide](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-webhooks/). Then, in Webhooks set up a redirection of selected data to ActiveCampaign.
    - **Manually adding the quiz leads to ActiveCampaign**: You can manually add the quiz leads to ActiveCampaign by uploading a CSV file generated from the quiz [responses](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) section.
    With the quiz integrated via [one of our alternative methods](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-activecampaign/#alternative-ways-to-send-quiz-leads-to-activecampaign), you should be able to tag contact profiles with additional custom information derived from quiz results.
    Here‚Äôs a list of additional custom information that can be added to your contact profile:
    - Email
    - First Name
    - Full Name
    - Quiz ID
    - Quiz Name
    - Response ID
    - Tags
    - Permalink
    - Permalink Hash
    - Recommended Product IDs
    !!! warning
        Since you are using one of our alternative methods to connect to ActiveCampaign, you will have full control over the data that is sent to ActiveCampaign. The data provided above are only a list of the most common fields that are sent to ActiveCampaign.
        For more information about using data in customer profile for ActiveCampaign, please refer to [ActiveCampaign documentation](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001374664-How-to-manage-custom-contact-fields).
    To set up a redirection of selected data to ActiveCampaign, you can use our Webhooks integration. Just connect your quiz to Webhooks following [this guide](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-webhooks/). Then, check [ActiveCampaign's webhooks documentation](https://developers.activecampaign.com/page/webhooks) for more information on how to set up a redirection of selected data to ActiveCampaign.
    To send automatic follow-up emails to quiz takers, you can set up an automation in ActiveCampaign.
    To automate email communications based on quiz participation:
    1. Within ActiveCampaign, go to the `Automations` menu and create a new automation.
    2. Set a trigger related to the custom properties you added to the contact profile via Webhooks.
    3. Following the trigger setup, design your email template. Incorporate personalization by adding `custom properties`, such as direct links to quiz responses, to your text blocks.
        ![how to activecampaign add custom properties](/images/how_to_activecampaign_add_custom_properties.gif)
    Unfortunately, for now, the only information about the recommended products we were able to send to Activecampaign is the Recommended Product IDs. This is not enough information to display the whole list of recommended products.
    To show any products in an ActiveCampaign you may need to connect your ActiveCampaign to Shopify first. Then by adding a product block, you should be able to display products from specific collections. It could be possible to add multiple product blocks and have them shown or hidden based on the recommended product ID, however, this option has not been yet tested thoroughly.

    1. To view the imported data, navigate to the `contacts` section within HubSpot.
    2. Select any contact that has taken the quiz, and click on `view all properties` to examine the details.
        ![how to hubspot properties1](/images/how_to_hubspot_image1.png)
    3. You will find a section labeled `Product Recommendation Quiz` or similarly, depending on your [quiz data redirection setup](#alternative-ways-to-send-quiz-leads-to-hubspot). This section houses all quiz-related data, including answers and product recommendations.

        Once the quiz data is sent to Hubspot, the rest is out of our app‚Äôs scope, and any particular questions on how to set up the flows and how to build the email templates should be directed to Hubspot.
    1. Once your quiz is sending data to Hubspot, you can set up an [email campaign](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/campaigns/create-campaigns) in Hubspot.
    2. The first step is creating a segment that contains only quiz takers. You can use custom properties sent to Hubspot profiles to create **segmented lists** based your customers responses to the quiz so you can follow up with hyper-segmented campaigns.
        !!! tip
            Check [this HubSpot article](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/lists/create-active-or-static-lists) to learn how to create lists.
    3. You can use the segment as a trigger for your campaign, ensuring that only quiz takers receive the email.
    4. Set up your campaign and email flow.
    5. You can use the **Personalization Token** feature to personalize the email based on the quiz data. Check the [Using Custom Quiz Properties in Email Templates](#using-custom-quiz-properties-in-email-templates) section to learn how to do this.
    6. Turn your campaign on and Hubspot will automatically send the email to the customers in the segment, helping you follow up with your quiz takers and recover lost sales.
    To personalize your follow-up emails based on quiz data, you‚Äôll need to pull custom properties into the email templates.
    1. In HubSpot, navigate to `Marketing > Email > Create email`.
    2. In the email editor, use the **Personalization Token** feature.
    3. Click on `Insert`, then select Personalization Token from the dropdown.
        ![how to hubspot image5](/images/how_to_hubspot_image5.png)
    4. Choose the custom quiz properties that were captured with your Product Recommendation Quiz. HubSpot will automatically replace these tokens with each contact's respective data during the email send.
    5. Use the `Preview` feature to ensure that the custom properties are appearing correctly in your email.
        ![how to hubspot image6](/images/how_to_hubspot_image6.png)

        1. To create a new segment in Klaviyo go to  `Audience > List & Segements` and click `Create New > New Segment`.
        2. Name the segment and set up the definition. 
        3. Segment definition: Select `Properties about someone` and add a property that will be unique for profiles coming from the quiz. This can be any of the [custom properties](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/#use-quiz-data-in-klaviyo-email-templates) that RevenueHunt sends to Klaviyo Profiles.
            !!! example "Example"
                - `ANSWERS_BY_BLOCK-QuizID` property is unique for profiles coming from the quiz.  
                - If you don't see the `ANSWERS_BY_BLOCK-QuizID` property in the dropdown menu, you may need to take a test quiz and try again.
        4. Segment definition: As segment definition set up a rule that follows this format: `Custom property from the Quiz` `is set` Type: `text`.
            !!! example "Example"
                - `ANSWERS_BY_BLOCK-QuizID` `is set` Type: `text`.
        5. Click `Create a segment` and wait for Klaviyo to load all the contacts that match the segment definition. This may take a few minutes.
        6. Once the agent finishes loading, all the profiles that already match the segment definition will be added to the segment. New contacts coming from the quiz will be added to the segment automatically.
    4. **Create an Email Flow**: You‚Äôll have to create a flow that is triggered when someone gets added to the segment we created in the previous step. This is the trickiest part, the emails you send have to be custom-built in Klaviyo. 
        **Trigger the Flow**
        1. To create an email flow that includes only quiz takers open the `Flows` tab in Klaviyo. 
        2. Click `Create flow` and then `Build from scratch`.
        3. Name the flow and click `Create flow`.
        4. Next, you'll be asked to set up a flow trigger.
        5. Choose the trigger to be `Added to a segment` and select the segment created in the [previous step](/tutorials/follow-up-emails-klaviyo/#create-segment-for-quiz-takers). Click `Confirm` and `Confirm and save`. This way whenever someone enters the segment they will trigger the email flow.    
        **Optional: Update Marketing Consent**
        If you've [asked for marketing consent in the quiz](/how-to-guides/ask-for-marketing-consent/), you can update it in the Klaviyo email flow. Just follw these steps:
        1. Right below the flow trigger, add a `Profile property update` action.
        2. Click `+ Step`.
        3. A menu will appear letting up set up the profile property update.
        4. Select to `Update existing property`, from the Select property dropdown menu select `Accepts marketing` and set the value to `true`.
        5. Turn this action `LIVE`.
    6. **Edit the Email**: In the next steps, you should edit the email template.
        **Add Email Action**
        ![how to send leads to klaviyo built for shopify revenuehunt app create email flow](https://loom.com/i/01df24e93900407b9141998dfb070a2e?workflows_screenshot=true)
        1. Grab the `EMAIL` action and drop it below the flow trigger.
        **Edit the Email Template**
        2. In `Email details` section edit the Subject.
        3. Then, click `Select template`. You'll be taken to the Templates section in Klaviyo.
        4. To create a new email template, click `Create`. You'll be redirected to the Klaviyo email builder.
        5. In the Klaviyo email builder you can use pre-designed blocs to add images or text to your template. 
        6. To add the quiz content and quiz recommended products you'll need to add an `HTML` block. Drag and drop the `HTML` block to the email builder.
        7. In the `Quiz Settings > Integrations` section, you'll find a button to download a `Klaviyo Template`. Click the `Klaviyo Template` button and a new window will open. There, click `Copy code` to copy the existing template.
            !!! info "Klaviyo Template"

                ![how to send leads to klaviyo email tempalte download2](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_klaviyo_shopify_v2_copy_template.png)
                The code contains several ready-to-use code snippets that allow you to display: 
                - Quiz question answers (section `{# REFERENCE: INFORMATION GATHERED FROM THE QUESTIONS #}`)
                - Recommended products (section `{# REFERENCE: INDIVIDUAL ITEM RECOMMENDATIONS BY SLOT #}`)
                - A Static Results Page content that contains all the elements of your results page and adds content upon each quiz retake (section `{# REFERENCE: INDIVIDUAL ITEM RECOMMENDATIONS BY SLOT #}`)
                - A Dynamic Results Page content that contains all the elements of your results page and replaces content upon each quiz retake (section `{# RECOMMENDED: DYNAMIC RESULT PAGE CONTENT (LOOPS THROUGH RESULT_SECTIONS-jGzry2) #}`) **üëà this section is the recommended one to use**
        8. Paste the code in the `HTML` block in Klaviyo email.
            ![how to send leads to klaviyo built for shopify revenuehunt app example template in klaviyo](https://loom.com/i/04a9f5a3d3a040d2a97c2b393fc18c41?workflows_screenshot=true)
        9. Next, `Preview` the email as one of your segment subscribers to check what information is displayed.
        10. You can freely edit the email template to your liking. For example, you can remove all the sections of the code that you don't need. You can also style the provided email code. Keep in mind, that you may need help from a developer to edit the tempalte code. Alternatively, you can try asking [Quiz Copilot](/how-to-guides/use-quiz-copilot/) or another AI agent like ChatGPT or Claude for help in styling the email.
            ??? info "Create your own email template"
                Check the [Use quiz data in Klaviyo email templates](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/#use-quiz-data-in-klaviyo-email-templates) article to learn how to customize your Klaviyo email template with quiz properties.
        11. Once you're happy with the email template, click `Exit` then `Done` and return to your flow.
        12. Turn your email `LIVE`.
        From that moment on, all the quiz takers, who leave their email, will be automatically added to your Kalviyo Segment and will be sent a follow-up email. 
    8. **Re-trigger the flow**: If you want to send an email with each quiz retake, you can do that by adding a `Profile property update` action at the end of the flow. Follow these steps:
        1. Add a `Profile property update` action at the end of the flow.
        2. Click `+ Step`.
        3. Select `Delete existing property`.
        4. From the `Select property` dropdown menu select the property that was used to create a segment in earlier steps. 
            !!! example "Example"
                Select `Delete existing property` > `ANSWERS_BY_BLOCK-QuizID`. 
                ![how to send leads to klaviyo resend email with each quiz retake](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_klaviyo_resend_email_with_each_quiz_retake.png)
            ??? info "How to send an email every time someone completes the quiz?"
                First, you need to set up a segment based on (for example) the `ANSWERS_BY_BLOCK-{{quiz_id}}` property to filter quiz takers. Once the segment is created, you can build a flow that triggers when users are added to this segment, sends them their quiz results via email, and then **removes the `ANSWERS_BY_BLOCK-{{quiz_id}}` property from their profile** to allow for re-entry if they retake the quiz.
                For example:
                ![how to send leads to klaviyo resend email with each quiz retake](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_klaviyo_resend_email_with_each_quiz_retake.png)
        5. Save the changes and turn the action `LIVE`.
        This way, each time a quiz taker takes the quiz again, they will be re-added to the segment and will trigger the email flow again.

    If you need to modify our Klaviyo email template to match your brand‚Äôs style guide, you‚Äôll need a developer because email templates in Klaviyo are built using HTML, CSS and the [Django templating](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/templates/builtins/) system.
    **Custom Properties in Klaviyo**
    We send all the responses to the quiz and the recommended products along with the contact information to the customer‚Äôs Klaviyo profile. This information will appear in the customer‚Äôs profile as `custom properties`.
    ![how to send leads to klaviyo customer profile](/images/how_to_klaviyo_shopify_v2_customer_profile.png)
    If you need to add any additional information to the email template, your developer can do so by pulling the appropriate `custom properties` from the user profile.
    ??? info "Learn the person|lookup function"
        To build your own email template based on the custom properties we send to Klaviyo, you should familiarize yourself with the [message personalization reference](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408802648731) in Klaviyo, aka the `{{ person|lookup:"..." }}` function.
    ??? warning "Overwriting or Appending Custom Properties"	
        Some custom properties sent to Klaviyo from the quiz such as `ANSWER_BY_BLOCK`, `CHOICE`, `RESPONSE_ID`, `RESULT_REF`, `RESULT_SECTIONS` or `TAGS` are sent as an array, meaning that their values get **overwritten** with new data upon each quiz completion.
        However, properties such as `RECOMMENDATIONS_BY_SLOT` or `RESULT_CONTENT_BY_BLOCK` are sent as a JSON object, meaning that their values get **appended** to the existing data upon each quiz completion. 
        If you want to make sure that in your Klaviyo template, the **values get overwritten** with new data upon each quiz completion and you want to use our pre-defined Klaviyo email tempalte which you can download from [Integrations](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab, make sure to only use the code snippet that starts with the following comment:
        ```html
        {# ================================================================= #}
        {# DYNAMIC RESULT PAGE CONTENT (LOOPS THROUGH RESULT_SECTIONS-lBJ9bk) #}
        {# This template loops through the result sections and blocks          #}
        {# It will adapt if you change the results page structure in the quiz editor #}

        ??? tip "Tip: Use Copilot or AI to style the code"
            You can use [Quiz Copilot](/how-to-guides/use-quiz-copilot/) or another AI agent like ChatGPT or Gemini to generate a styled version of the code.
    4. You can use elements of the code in your Klaviyo template elements. 
        !!! example "Example: Display Product Title in Text Block"
            For example, you can use the `{{ person|lookup:'RECOMMENDATIONS_BY_SLOT-YN5L9G'|lookup:'rsbss-ca4fba94'|lookup:'0'|lookup:'title' }}` to display the title of the first product in a text block.
            ![how_to_shipifyv2_klaviyo_template_productlist4](/images/how_to_shipifyv2_klaviyo_template_productlist4.png)
        !!! info "Sample Product Object Structure"
            In this example, here's a product object structure that was sent to Klaviyo:
            - Display recommendation of **item 0** for **slot rsbss-ca4fba94**
            - Title: `{{ person|lookup:'RECOMMENDATIONS_BY_SLOT-YN5L9G'|lookup:'rsbss-ca4fba94'|lookup:'0'|lookup:'title' }}`
            - Description: `{{ person|lookup:'RECOMMENDATIONS_BY_SLOT-YN5L9G'|lookup:'rsbss-ca4fba94'|lookup:'0'|lookup:'description' }}`	
            - Price: `{{ person|lookup:'RECOMMENDATIONS_BY_SLOT-YN5L9G'|lookup:'rsbss-ca4fba94'|lookup:'0'|lookup:'price'|lookup:'amount' }} {{ person|lookup:'RECOMMENDATIONS_BY_SLOT-YN5L9G'|lookup:'rsbss-ca4fba94'|lookup:'0'|lookup:'price'|lookup:'currencyCode' }}`
            - Online URL: `{{ person|lookup:'RECOMMENDATIONS_BY_SLOT-YN5L9G'|lookup:'rsbss-ca4fba94'|lookup:'0'|lookup:'onlineUrl' }}`
            - Image URL: `{{ person|lookup:'RECOMMENDATIONS_BY_SLOT-YN5L9G'|lookup:'rsbss-ca4fba94'|lookup:'0'|lookup:'image'|lookup:'url' }}`
    ### Example 2 - Display Quiz Answers
    A Skincare Quiz with ID `YN5L9G` wants to display all customer answers in the email. 
    1. To do this, you can use the following code copied from the Klaviyo template in the [`Integrations`](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab:
        ![how_to_klaviyo_shopify_v2_get_template](/images/how_to_klaviyo_shopify_v2_get_template.png)

            <br>
            </p>
            ```
    2. When this code is copied into an HTML block in a Klaviyo template and previewd as one of the quiz subscribes is will display a full list of all the answers.
        ![how_to_shipifyv2_klaviyo_template_answerslist1](/images/how_to_shipifyv2_klaviyo_template_answerslist1.png)
    3. If you want to show specific answers in your email template, you can copy parts of the code. 
        !!! example "Example: Display Answer for Q3: AGE GROUP"
            For example, you can use `{{ person|lookup:'ANSWER_BY_BLOCK-qbc-dd744cf3-YN5L9G' }}` to  display answer for Q3: AGE GROUP (ref qbc-dd744cf3).
            Here's how to use it in a Klaviyo template text block:
            ![how_to_shipifyv2_klaviyo_template_answerslist2](/images/how_to_shipifyv2_klaviyo_template_answerslist2.png)
        !!! info "Sample Answer Object Structure"
            In this example, here's how to get answers for a specific question:

            Q11: WE'VE GOT YOUR RESULTS - #2 [multiple_choice]: `{{ person|lookup:'ANSWER_BY_BLOCK-qbc-cb601cf6-YN5L9G' }}`
    ### Example 3 - Display Link to Quiz Results
    Use the `RESPONSE_ID-QuizID` to create a link to the quiz results page. 
    1. Just add `#response-{{ person|lookup:'RESPONSE_ID-QuizID' }}` to the end of your results page href attribute in any link or URL. 
        !!! example "Example: Link to Quiz Results"
            `<a href="https://yourwebsite.com/#response-{{ person|lookup:'RESPONSE_ID-Gli0KD' }}">View your quiz results</a>`
            where `Gli0KD` is the quiz ID and
            - `{{ person|lookup:'RESPONSE_ID-Gli0KD' }}` fetches the dynamic response ID (e.g., eVgV0Y).

# How to Send Leads to Mailchimp

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

While the new Built for Shopiify version of the RevenueHunt app **does not** yet integrate directly with Mailchimp, it is still possible to send quiz leads to Mailchimp.
    One option includes using our [Webhooks](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-webhooks/) integration to send quiz leads to Mailchimp. Another, includes manually adding the quiz leads to Mailchimp by uploading a CSV file generated from the quiz.
    This guide explain how you can send quiz data to Mailchimp with a workaround.
    It is **not yet possible** to link your Product Recommendation Quiz created in the new Built for Shopify version of the RevenueHunt app to Mailchimp.
    Check [Alternative Ways to Send Quiz Leads to Mailchimp](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-mailchimp/#alternative-ways-to-send-quiz-leads-to-mailchimp) to learn how you can send quiz leads to Mailchimp anyway.
    Sometimes, you would like a bit more control over the data that is sent to Mailchimp. In that case there are a few alternatives you can use to send quiz leads to Mailchimp.
    - **Using Webhooks**: You can use our Webhooks integration to send quiz leads to Mailchimp. Just connect your quiz to Webhooks following [this guide](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-webhooks/). Then, in Webhooks set up a redirection of selected data to Mailchimp.
    - **Manually adding the quiz leads to Mailchimp**: You can manually add the quiz leads to Mailchimp by uploading a CSV file generated from the quiz [responses](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) section.
    With [customer tags](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/#customer-tags), you can segment your audience within Mailchimp based on their quiz responses:
    1. Make sure the quiz is connected to Mailchimp. 
    2. Create [customer tags](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/#customer-tags) in the RevenueHunt app and link them to choices.
        ![how to send leads to mailchimp tags](/images/how_to_shiopifyv2_send_leads_to_mailchimp_tags.png)
    3. Once done, click the `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz with new changes.
    4. Navigate to the `Audience` section in your Mailchimp account.
    5. Use the customer tags to create segmented lists or groups, allowing for targeted campaign efforts based on the quiz outcomes.
    To override Mailchimp's limitation on pushing detailed custom quiz data, you can use `customer tags` to represent customer responses.
    1. For each possible quiz answer, create a corresponding [customer tag](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/#customer-tags) within your quiz setup. This requires planning to ensure each tag accurately represents the quiz responses.
        ![how to send leads to mailchimp tags](/images/how_to_shiopifyv2_send_leads_to_mailchimp_tags.png)
    2. Upon completion of the quiz by a participant, Mailchimp will receive all the tags that the customer picked based on their choices.
    If you want to set up a post-quiz email flow with Mailchimp, you can follow the steps below:
    1. **Connect Your Quiz to MailChimp.** Follow the instructions in the [Alternative Ways to Send Quiz Leads to Mailchimp](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-mailchimp/#alternative-ways-to-send-quiz-leads-to-mailchimp) section to send your quiz leads to Mailchimp.
        !!! tip
            Remember to take a test quiz/preview the quiz leaving a sample email address in order to send first data to MailChimp and test the connection. You can use your real email with a +test1, +test2 to test different answering routes. For example, youremail+test1@email.com or youremail+test2@email.com.
    2. **Use Customer Tags for Segmentation.** Once your quiz data is redirected to Mailchimp, you should consider what data you want to send to MailChimp from the quiz. You can, for example:
        - [Create customer tags in your quiz](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/#customer-tags) to represent different quiz responses.
        - Link these tags to specific answers in your quiz.
        - Upon completion of the quiz by a participant, Mailchimp should receive all the tags that the customer picked based on their choices. 
            !!! warning
                Make sure you have configured the redirection of these tags to Mailchimp via your [workaround](#alternative-ways-to-send-quiz-leads-to-mailchimp).
        - In MailChimp, you can use these tags to segment your audience and tailor your email campaigns.
        !!! warning
            Mailchimp API only supports email, name, and customer tags to be send from the quiz. To override Mailchimp‚Äôs limitation on pushing detailed quiz data, you can use customer tags to represent customer responses.
    3. **Design Email Campaigns.** Once the quiz answers are covered with customer tags, all the information you need about your customer will start flowing into MailChimp. That‚Äôs when you can set up your email campaigns. 
        - You can start by setting up Automations (automated email flows) to trigger based on specific tags or quiz completions.
        - Then, create different email templates in MailChimp that correspond to different quiz outcomes or automation flows.
        !!! example
            Imagine you run a skincare eCommerce store. Your quiz asks customers about their skin type and concerns. Based on their answers, you tag them as ‚ÄúOily Skin,‚Äù ‚ÄúDry Skin,‚Äù etc.
            In MailChimp, you create an email series targeting these tags. For instance:

# How to Send Leads to Omnisend

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

Apart from giving your customers a personalized product recommendation, you can connect Product Recommendation Quiz to your Omnisend account so that the quiz results are sent automatically to your mailing list. This way you can segment them based on their responses and follow up with targeted campaigns.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/763403d8f6e74461875845e68fe39e12?sid=2103a65c-be3d-4efd-80d8-a01173a4a30b" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    This article explains how to connect your quiz to Omnisend, create a segment for quiz participants and how to send the quiz results to your mailing list.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/89d2f35bb4f24d0cac4ea5dc0cdaa08c?sid=ee552793-e4bf-4d77-a870-ae809b9a7649" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    1. **Add an email question**: Ensure your quiz includes an [**email question**](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#email), as this is essential for sending data to Omnisend. If an email question is missing, you can add one from the `+ Add Question` menu or insert an email block into an existing question.
    2. **Generate Omnisend API Key**: First, you'll have to [generate a new API Key in Omnisend](https://app.omnisend.com/integrations/api-keys). 
        - Log in to your Omnisend account.
        - Go to **Store Settings** > **API** and create a new API key.
        - Name the key (e.g., 'Skincare Basic API Key for Quiz', 'RevenueHunt API Key', etc.) and grant all permissions.
        - Copy the generated API key.
        ![how to send leads to omnisend api key generate](/images/how_to_omnisend_create_api_key.png){:width="500px"}
    3. **Connect to Omnisend**: Access the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** and select the **Omnisend** tab. In the field that appears, you'll need to enter your `Omnisend API Key` into the input field, then click `Save`.
        ![how to send leads to omnisend paste api key](https://loom.com/i/28f3ffb0c36a46e5886b04a9d05a144c?workflows_screenshot=true)
    4. **Preview your quiz**: After connecting to Omnisend, preview your quiz all the way to the results page to send the first contact. Use a sample email (e.g., 'alexa@example.com') and provide sample answers to populate properties in Omnisend.
    5. **Check your profile**: Go back to the Omnisend platform and navigate to the **Dashboard** > **Audience** > **Contacts**. Check if the sample profile (e.g., 'Alexa RevenueHunt / alexa@example.com') has been added. Click on the profile to view all custom properties from the quiz, including: 
        - Quiz answers
        - Recommended products
        - Quiz name
        - Product links, names, and images.
    Following these steps ensures that every time a customer completes your quiz, their contact details, quiz responses, and product recommendations are automatically sent to your Omnisend account. 
    We send all the responses to the quiz and the recommended products along with the contact information to the customer‚Äôs Omnisend profile. This information will appear in the customer‚Äôs profile as `custom properties`.
    ![how to omnisend custom properties](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_omnisend_custom_properties.gif)
    If you need to add any additional information to the email template, your developer can do so by [pulling the appropriate custom properties from the user profile](#use-quiz-data-in-omnisend-email-templates).
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/5b60359870e449bfa3a6c9b1a867abfc?sid=a941f0aa-abc6-48dd-a885-e1752df8e036" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    It‚Äôs possible to set up a post-quiz email campaign in Omnisend to send the product recommendations or other offers to the quiz participants. 
    Below you‚Äôll find some basic instructions that you can follow to set up an email flow in Omnisend. It covers creating a segment for quiz takers, setting up an automation workflow, and customizing email content with quiz results.
    !!! warning
        Email templates and flows are not something that‚Äôs a one-click install. It should be built by someone with technical knowledge and experience in Omnisend.
        Once the quiz is connected to Omnisend (and the data is sent there), it‚Äôs out of our app‚Äôs scope, and any particular questions on how to set up the flows and how to build the email templates should be directed to Omnisend.
    1. **Connect Your Quiz to Omnisend**: Refer to the instructions provided [here](#link-quiz-to-omnisend) to ensure your quiz is correctly connected to Omnisend.
    2. **Create a Segment for Quiz Participants**: In Omnisend, [create a segment](https://support.omnisend.com/en/articles/1400415-creating-segments) specifically for users who have completed the quiz. This can be done by filtering for a `custom property` that only quiz participants will have, such as `quiz_QUIZID_quiz_name`.
        ![how to omnisend segment](/images/how_to_omnisend_create_segment.png)
        - Use the custom properties to create a segment for users who took the quiz. Select a property (e.g., `quiz_QUIZID_quiz_name`) and copy it.
        - Go to 'Audience' > 'Segments' and create a new segment from scratch.
        - Add a filter using the copied property.
        - Name the segment something recognizable, e.g., 'Skincare Quiz Basic Segment' and save it.
        - Omnisend will automatically add profiles with this property to the segment.
    3. **Set Up an Automated Workflow**: Develop an [automation workflow](https://support.omnisend.com/en/articles/3954813-omnisend-automation-workflow-settings) in Omnisend that triggers when someone is added to the newly created segment of quiz participants. This step involves configuring Omnisend to automatically start the email campaign sequence for users in this segment.
        ![how to omnisend flow](https://loom.com/i/2e3ebc719c764822935b79d68c67456b?workflows_screenshot=true)
        - Navigate to the 'Automation' section in OmniSend.
        - Explore existing workflows or create a new workflow from scratch.
        - Set a trigger for the workflow: select 'When someone enters the segment' and choose the segment you created, e.g., 'Skincare Quiz Basic Segment'.
        - Save the changes to initiate the workflow when users enter the segment.
    4. **Customize the Email Template**: Customizing the email template to include quiz results and product recommendations requires HTML, CSS, and [Django templating](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/templates/builtins/) knowledge. Use Omnisend‚Äôs existing email templates as a base and modify them to incorporate the quiz data as custom properties. Ensure the template aligns with your brand‚Äôs style guide.
        - Drag and drop an email action below the trigger in the workflow.
        - Set the email subject (e.g., 'Your Quiz Results') and add a subheader.
        - Edit the email content as needed, then save changes to access the email editor.
    5. **Include Quiz Results in the Email**: To include quiz results in the email, add an HTML element to the email builder.
        - In the quiz builder, navigate to 'Settings' > 'Integrations' and generate an OmniSend email template.
            ![how to omnisend email template](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_omnisend_template.png){:width="500px"}
        - Copy the generated code and paste it into the HTML block of your email template in OmniSend.
            ![how to omnisend email template](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_omnisend_template_copy.png)
        - This code will create a pre-formatted email with quiz results and recommended products, which can be further edited as needed.
    6. **Preview and test the email**: Preview and test the email as one of the segment subscribers. Complete any additional follow-up steps in the workflow.
    7. **Save all changes and start the workflow**: Save all changes and start the workflow to activate the automation for quiz takers.
    You can use the quiz data in your Omnisend email templates by using the `custom properties` that are passed from the quiz to your Omnisend account.
    ![how to omnisend custom properties](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_omnisend_custom_properties.gif)
    If you need to add any additional information to the email template, your developer can do so by [pulling the appropriate custom properties from the user profile](https://support.omnisend.com/en/articles/1061885-custom-properties-for-contacts).
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 53.125%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/1911ea75ad7d4531b3886b0fd5af01a7?sid=741a1bb2-72bb-41ee-be1b-390654e18369" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    You can pull the customer answers into an email template by using the `custom properties` that are passed from the quiz to your Omnisend account. This is done by using the `insert personalization tag` feature in Omnisend.
    1. Navigate to your OmniSend automation workflow. Select the email you want to edit. Begin editing the content to create a new template.
    2. Add a text element to your email template. Type a base message, e.g., "You said that your skin feels...".
    3. Access the text block settings to `insert personalization tag`.
    4. Use the personalization tag feature to browse available custom properties from quiz profiles.    
    5. Search for the specific answer related to the quiz question (e.g., `quiz_LKKT6j_answer_qbc_485600ce`).
        ![how to omnisend insert personalization tag](/images/how_to_omnisend_insert_personalization_tag.png){:width="500px"}
    6. Insert the custom property into your text element. You can optionally provide default text. 
        ![how to omnisend personalization tag](https://loom.com/i/69abdc33b47a4321b8b0001e5f1a57ba?workflows_screenshot=true)
    7. Save your changes to the email template.
    8. Use the preview feature to test the template with a specific profile (e.g., Alexa Revenue Hunt). Confirm that the custom property is correctly displayed in the email content, reflecting the user's quiz response.
    9. Save the email template.
    Use the `quiz_QUIZID_response_id` to create a link to the quiz results page. Just add `#response-{{ person|lookup:'quiz_QUIZID_response_id' }}` to the end of your results page href attribute in any link or URL. 
    !!! example
        `<a href="https://yourwebsite.com/#response-{{ contact.custom.quiz_lBJ9bk_response_id }}">View your quiz results</a>` 
        where `lBJ9bk` is the quiz ID and
        - `{{ contact.custom.quiz_lBJ9bk_response_id }}` fetches the dynamic response ID (e.g., eVgV0Y).
    In the [Integrations](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) section, under `Omnisend`, you can find the `omnisend template`. 
    ![how to shopifyv2 omnisend template](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_omnisend_template.png)
    Click on the button to receive and copy an HTML email template specifically tailored for the quiz.
    ![how to shopifyv2 omnisend template copy](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_omnisend_template_copy.png)
    You can use this template as a reference to create your own.

# How to Send Quiz Leads to Shopify Customers

You can add new customers automatically to your Shopify Customers list every time someone completes the quiz. Once someone leaves their email in the quiz, their Shopify Customer profile will be updated with their name, email, phone number and [customer tags](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/#customer-tags).

This article explains how to connect your quiz to Shopify Customers and build a Shopify Flow targeted at quiz takers.

## Link Quiz to Shopify Customers

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 53.125%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/f0ee0d468b6d4e1faf8fa9a29383232a?sid=d238f4a2-85ce-4270-a7d6-2d63730b7155" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    1. Go to your quiz and click on the [Integrations](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab on the top of the screen. This will open a tab where you can connect your quiz with multiple third-party services.
    2. Then click on the `Connect` button in the `Shopify Customers` section. This will authorize our app to connect with your Shopify Customers List.
    ![how to integrate shopify customers built for shopify revenuehunt app](/images/how_to_integrate_shopify_customers_shopify_v2.png)
    3. Click the `Save` button to save the changes and update the preview/live quiz with new settings.
    Newly captured leads will appear in your Shopify Customers List with their [Customer Tags](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/#customer-tags) added to their profile.
    ![how to send leads to shopify customers customer profile](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_send_leads_to_shopify_customers_customer_profile.png)
    !!! note
        If a profile with the same email already exists, it will simply be updated with the customer tags from the quiz.
        Customer tags are updated every time a customer takes the quiz.
    By default, all the contacts added to the Shopify Customers list via the quiz **will be marked as subscribed** and their consent to receiving marketing information was given. It is not possible to change the default consent state.
    However, there are many ways you can ask the customer for marketing consent directly in the quiz. 
    !!! tip
        Check [this article](/how-to-guides/ask-for-marketing-consent/) to learn how to ask for marketing consent directly in the quiz.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 53.125%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/6d08be3b95f245fd8663aab9331b134a?sid=f059e142-595f-4f90-8182-173079ef6001" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    You can use [Customer Tags](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/#customer-tags) to send quiz answers that the customer provided in the quiz to their Shopify Customer's profile.
    Follow these steps to add tags to your quiz choices and test the setup:
    1. **Adding Tags to Quiz Choices**: To add tags to your quiz choices, follow these steps:
        - Open the Revenue Hunt Quizzes app and select your quiz.
        - Navigate to the choice settings section.
        - Under [Customer Tags](/reference/quiz-builder/customer-tags/), create new tags for each choice. For example, create a tag called `teen` and assign it to the relevant choice.
        - Repeat this process for other choices, adding appropriate tags as needed (e.g., `30s`).
        - Additionally, add a common tag (e.g., `quiz`) to all choices in one of the questions to identify participants from the product recommendation quiz. Anyone who takes the quiz will be tagged with this common tag.
    2. **Saving Changes**: After adding the desired tags, click `Save` to save your changes.
    3. **Test the quiz**: `Preview` the quiz using the same or a new email to test the tagging functionality.
    4. **Refresh the Shopify Customers list**: Once participants complete the quiz, refresh the Shopify Customers list to see the leads being added.
    5. **View the customer tags**: Open the profile of a participant to view their name, email, and the associated customer tags from the quiz.
    ![how to send leads to shopify customers customer profile](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_send_leads_to_shopify_customers_customer_profile.png)
    You can then use these tags to [create a Shopify email Flow](#set-up-shopify-automation-flow).
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 53.125%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/f0ee0d468b6d4e1faf8fa9a29383232a?sid=d238f4a2-85ce-4270-a7d6-2d63730b7155" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    ![how to shopify customers automation full cycle](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_customers_automation_full_cycle.png)
    1. To set up a post-quiz automation head to your `Shopify dashboard > Marketing > Automations`, click `View templates`.
    2. Select a `Create custom automation` automation:
        ![/how to send leads to shopify customers automation1](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_shopify_customers_automation1.png)
    3. **Add a trigger**: Click anywhere and select the first trigger to be `Customer created`.
        ![how to send leads to shopify customers automation2](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_shopify_customers_automation2.png)
    4. **Select a condition**: Add a `Condition` action after the trigger. Click `Add variable` and from the list look for `customer` and then `tags`. Then, set up the condition as follows: 
        **At least one customer / tags** `includes` tags_item  `quiz`.
        ![how to send leads to shopify customers automation3](/images/how_to_shopify_customers_flow_add_conditon.gif)
        ![how to send leads to shopify customers automation4](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_send_leads_to_shopify_customers_automation4.png)
    5. **Set up an email**: To send a follow-up email to all the quiz contacts that contain the `prq_ tag`(right after the tag is added to their profile), click `Then > Action` and from the list select `Send marketing email`. Next, select the email template you want to use.
        ![how to send leads to shopify customers automation6](/images/how_to_shopify_customers_flow_add_email.gif)
    6. **Save**: Remember to `Turn on workflow` once you're done with making the changes.
        ![how to shopify customers automation full cycle](/images/how_to_shopify_customers_automation_full_cycle.png)
    Now, all the quiz takers with a specific `tag` like `quiz` will be sent the marketing email.

# How to Send Leads to Zapier

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

While the new Built for Shopiify version of the RevenueHunt app **does not** yet integrate directly with Zapier, it is still possible to send quiz leads to Zapier.
    One option includes using our [Webhooks](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-webhooks/) integration to send quiz leads to Zapier. Another, includes manually adding the quiz leads to Zapier by uploading a CSV file generated from the quiz.
    This guide explain how you can send quiz data to Zapier with a workaround.
    It is **not yet possible** to link your Product Recommendation Quiz created in the new Built for Shopify version of the RevenueHunt app to Zapier.
    Check [Alternative Ways to Send Quiz Leads to Zapier](#alternative-ways-to-send-quiz-leads-to-zapier) to learn how you can send quiz leads to Zapier anyway.
    Sometimes, you would like a bit more control over the data that is sent to Zapier. In that case there are a few alternatives you can use to send quiz leads to Zapier.
    - **Using Webhooks**: You can use our Webhooks integration to send quiz leads to Zapier. Just connect your quiz to Webhooks following [this guide](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-webhooks/). Then, in Webhooks set up a redirection of selected data to Zapier.
    - **Manually adding the quiz leads to Zapier**: You can manually add the quiz leads to Zapier by uploading a CSV file generated from the quiz [responses](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) section.
    Since the new Built for Shopify version of the RevenueHunt app does not yet integrate directly with Zapier, you can control exactly what data is sent to Zapier by using our [Webhooks](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-webhooks/) integration.
    !!! tip
        Check [this guide](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-webhooks/) to learn how to send quiz leads to Zapier with Webhooks.
    Once you have connected your quiz to Zapier via Webhooks, you can build an email flow directly in Zapier to send customized follow-up emails right after the customer completes the quiz.

# How to Send Result Emails from Your Server Using SMTP

SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for sending emails across the internet. By connecting your Product Recommendation Quiz created with Revenuehunt app to an SMTP server, emails are sent from your account instead of revenuehunt, enhancing brand consistency and trust.

!!! tip "Connect your SMTP server to your quiz if:"
    - You're sending result emails to quiz respondents.
    - You're sending emails to a specific email address with notifications about each new quiz completion.

    Connecting your SMTP server to your quiz will allow you to send emails from your own email servers instead of Revenuehunt email servers and is a recommended practice.

## Setting Up SMTP Server Connection

        - **SMTP Port**: Enter the correct SMTP port number from your email provider's configuration.
        - **SMTP Authentication**: Select 'Plain' for authentication method.

        !!! note
            If you're not sure how to fill it in, try contacting your email service provider or check their documentation (search for "SMTP" on the documentation page).
    4. **Test and Activate**: After filling out the SMTP settings, click `Save` to test the connection. 
        If the connection fails, double-check all credentials, especially the SMTP port. 
        !!! tip
            If there are errors, please check the [troubleshooting guidelines](#troubleshooting-common-smtp-connection-issues).       
        Once successful, emails will be sent from your email server instead of Revenue Hunt's server.

# Setting Up Result Emails with Product Recommendation Quiz

Sending result emails to quiz takers can significantly improve your quiz sales by reducing cart abandonmemnt and improving the customer experince. With RevenueHunt app it is possible to set up quiz result emails directly without the need to connect the app to an external CRM service, though this option is also avialble.

This guide covers setting up email results for both [quiz respondents](#email-quiz-results-via-shop-quiz-app) and [administartors](#activate-email-notifications-to-admin) and well as sending results emails via an [external CRM service](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-crm/).

!!! tip "With RevenueHunt app you can:"

    - Send emails to quiz respondents with their quiz answers and results directly from the app.
    - Send emails to a specific email address with notifications about each new quiz completion.


!!! warning

    We recently encountered issues with our previous email provider and switched to a new service. Unfortunately, some emails were affected by this change, and not all messages have been going through as expected. 

    Starting on <b>November 29th, 2024</b>, we kindly ask you to [configure your SMTP settings](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails-from-custom-server/) to continue sending result emails through the app. Notification emails will now be sent from your email address ensuring deliverabilty and consistent branding.

        !!! warning
            Email template requires the knowledge of HTML and liquid to be edited. 
        - Incorporate quiz response metadata like `{{first_name}}` to personalize emails. You can use liquid code to loop through and display recommended products or customize content based on quiz outcomes. 
        - The email liquid template uses metadata (such as response ID, quiz name, user's name and email, answers to quiz questions, tags and recommended products, content from the results page) to recall information from the quiz.
            !!! tip
                To learn more about the metadata, check out the [Quiz Response Metadata Structure](#editing-email-templates).
        - You can find *useful code snippets* under the `Email Liquid Template` field and use them to insert specific data into the email template (e.g., 'Responses by Block' snippet to list user answers).

                You can copy the useful code snippets and paste them into a large languge model like ChatGPT or Gemini to style the liquid email template.
        !!! note
            Note that HTML emails are not rendered the same in different email clients and that you should add styles inline, not as classes.

    Show an link to the quiz results page: Use the `responseId` to create a link to the quiz results page. Just add `#response-{{ responseId }}` to the end of your results page URL in any link.
    ```liquid
    <a href="https://yourwebsite.com/#response-{{ responseId }}">View your quiz results</a>
    ```
    Show Recommended Products: If your quiz sends recommended products under `recommendationsBySlot`, you can display them like this:
    ```liquid
    {% assign products = person.recommendationsBySlot['rsbss-ca4fba94'] %}
    {% for product in products %}
    <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
        <img src="{{ product.image.url }}" alt="{{ product.title }}" width="200" />
        <h3>{{ product.vendor }} - {{ product.title }}</h3>
        <p>{{ product.description }}</p>
        <p><strong>{{ product.price.amount }} {{ product.price.currencyCode }}</strong></p>
        <a href="https://yourstore.com/products/{{ product.handle }}">Shop now</a>
    </div>
    {% endfor %}
    ```
    Show Custom Headings from Results Page: You can also pull headings or tips from `resultContentByBlock` by using a code like `{{ person.resultContentByBlock['rsbt-159c2a74'].content }}` or loop through result content blocks:
    ```liquid
    {% for block_id, block in person.resultContentByBlock %}
    {% if block.type == 'text' %}
        {{ block.content }}
    {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    ```

# How to Set Up Multiple Result Pages

With the RevenueHunt app it is possible to set up Multiple Results Pages. To add an extra Results Page to your quiz follow the instructions below.

!!! warning

    Adding multiple results pages increases complexity, may lead to unexpected product recommendations, and can impact quiz loading speed. **For maximum conversions and sales, we recommend using only one results page.**

    However, multiple results pages can be beneficial in certain scenarios:

    - Personalized discounts: Show different discounts (or no discount) based on customer preferences or responses.
    - Email collection strategies: Offer unique results based on whether the customer leaves their email address or not.
    - Simplifying conditional logic: If you have a long list of similar conditional blocks, using multiple results pages can make it easier to organize and manage logic by giving each page a clear name.
    - Special cases: Some businesses, like medical & supplements companies, might use separate results pages to inform customers when they are not eligible for certain products, e.g., "You're not qualified for X due to [specific reason]."

    Carefully consider your quiz goals before enabling this feature to ensure it aligns with your business objectives.

        !!! example
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness ‚Äì we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that's deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn't experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin's natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
    3. **Add Product Blocks**: To each block add a `Product Block` with the products you want to recommend for that skin type. Make sure to set the `Recommendation System` to `Fixed Recommendations` in the [Product Block Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections).

# How to Set Up Funnel Quiz

A Funnel Quiz helps your customers find the best product by assigning "votes" to products as they answer questions. The quiz counts these votes and recommends the most relevant products at the end.

!!! info "Use this method for:"

    - Helping customers narrow down a large product catalog
    - Most quizzes, especially product finders
    - Your first product recommendation quiz
    - Quizzes without complex branching


## ‚úçüèª Voting System

Our product recommendation algorithm works like a voting system:

- Product variants are linked to each choice.
- When a customer picks a choice, all linked products receive one vote.
- After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted product variants sorted by the number of votes.
- If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty.
- If there's a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the order of products.

**Understand Inclusion and Exclusion**

### Inclusion
Products or collections added in the `include/upvotes` field of the [Link Products/Collections/Upvote](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) tab are upvoted in the final recommendations.

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

![how to recommend products upvote](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_questions_blocksettings_multiplechoice_choicesettings.png)
    How the votes work for each upvoted item:
    - **Main Products / All variants of the same product at once**: All variants of a product get upvoted at once when their linked choice is selected.
    - **Product variants**: Individual variants receive a vote when their linked choice is selected. Note that only product variants are directly linked to choices. However, on the results page, variants can be grouped under their parent products for a streamlined shopping experience.
    - **Collections**: Every product within a linked collection receives a vote when their linked choice is selected.
    - **Tags**: Every product within a linked tag receives a vote when their linked choice is selected.
    - **Variant collections**: Created automatically by the app, every product within a linked variant collection receives a vote when their linked choice is selected.
    - **Vendor collections**: Created automatically by the app, every product within a linked vendor collection receives a vote when their linked choice is selected.
    !!! tip
        You can also recommend pure text results by setting up different sections on the results page and controlling visibility of each section with Display Logic. This option is not dependent on the voting system but rather on custom scoring system or conditional logic.
    ![how to recommend products exclusion](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_questions_blocksettings_multiplechoice_choicesettings.png)
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 74.27785419532324%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/f249d672fe414dc390715b210a94a75a?sid=0a795570-01c5-4777-b6b1-62b0a0da3387" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz can show on the results page **product variants**, **main products** and **collections**.
    Follow these steps to set up product recommendations in your Product Recommendation Quiz:
    1. **Link Products to Choices**: Navigate to the [Upvote](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) tab within your quiz setup. For each choice, upvote relevant products. 
        Products or collections added in the `upvotes` field of the [Upvote](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) tab are upvoted in the final recommendations.
        ![how to recommend products inclusion](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_setuprecommendations_linkcollections.png)
        !!! tip
            Think carefully about which products are upvoted in each choice. You can create special **hidden collections** for each choice in Shopify and add only relevant products to them. Then you can link collections to choices rather than individual products for easier management.
        ??? question "How the votes work for each included linked item?"
            You can upvote product variants, collections, tags, variant collections, vendor collections or all variants of the same product at once.
            - **Product variants**: Individual variants receive a vote when their linked choice is selected. Note that only product variants are directly linked to choices. However, on the results page, variants can be grouped under their parent products for a streamlined shopping experience.
            - **Collections**: Every product within a linked collection receives a vote when their linked choice is selected.
            - **Tags**: Every product within a linked tag receives a vote when their linked choice is selected.
            - **Variant collections**: Created automatically by the app, every product within a linked variant collection receives a vote when their linked choice is selected.
            - **Vendor collections**: Created automatically by the app, every product within a linked vendor collection receives a vote when their linked choice is selected.
            - **All variants of the same product at once**: All variants of a product get upvoted at once when their linked choice is selected. Note: A special setting called `Use top-level product` in [Quiz Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/) needs to be active for this option to appear in the Link Products section.
        ??? warning "How does product **exclusion** work in the voting system?"
            Use the `exclude` field of the [Exclude](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) tab to remove certain products or collections from the recommendations, useful for items with allergens or sensitive ingredients. 
            ![how to recommend products exclusion](/images/how_to_recommend_products_exclusion.png)
            !!! warning
                Once a product is excluded in a choice it will **never show** as a recommendation, even if it's upvoted in another choice earlier/later in the quiz.
            !!! example
                If you want the recommended products to be filtered out by question, you can do that using the `exclude` feature. For example, if you want to show only recommendations within a certain price range, you can use the exclude collections feature as in the example below.
                ![how to recommend products exclusion example](/images/how_to_recommend_products_exclusion_example.png)
                This way if a customer chooses that he doesn't want to spend more than 100$, all the products over that price will be excluded from the recommendations.
    2. **Edit the Results Page**: In the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) tab you can edit the content of your results screen. 
        - You can add a heading, content block, image block, HTML block or a Product Block. 
        ![how_to_shopifyv2_setuprecommendations_editresults](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_setuprecommendations_editresults.png)
        !!! tip
            Check [How to Edit the Results Page](/how-to-guides/edit-results-page/) for more information.
    3. **Add a Product Block**: Products or variants or collections can be displayed on the Results Page as a list via the `Products Block`. 
        - Click `+ Add Block` and select [`Products Block`](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections) to add it to your results page.
        ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_blocktypes](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_blocktypes.png)
        - In Product Block settings you can chose the `Recommendation system` to be `Based on customer's responses`. the **Product Block** then displays the products sorted by the number of votes - the most voted products are shown first, and the least voted last.
        ![how to recommend products built for shopify revenuehunt app recommend products based on responses](/images/how_to_recommend_products_shopify_v2_recommend_products_based_on_responses.png){width="35%"}
        - Every Product Block comes with a default `Slot` that allows you to display the recommended products. In [Slot settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) you can **choose how many products you want to show** at the end of the quiz.
        ![how to recommend products built for shopify revenuehunt app recommend products based on responses max products](/images/how_to_recommend_products_shopify_v2_recommend_products_based_on_responses_max_products.png){width="300"}
        - Then the results page will show the products like this, sorted by the number of votes:
        ![how to recommend products product block](/images/how_to_recommend_products_product_block.png){width="500"}
        !!! note
            Product Block also allows you to display the products in clear steps, for example as a **skincare routine**. Each Product Block that has an added **Segement Filter** can recommend the most-voted product from a collection that's linked to it. Check [How to Recommend a Skincare Routine with Slots](/how-to-guides/recommend-skincare-routine-slots/) for step-by-step instructions on how to set up Slot Blocks.
    4. **Test the Results**: After your products are linked and the results page is set up, you can test your quiz.
        - Click [`Save`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) on the top-right menu to update the preview/live quiz. 
        - Then, click [`Preview`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) to test the quiz you've created in a new window. 
            !!! note
                You can test the quiz as much as you like as long as you always open a new preview window. These test responses done as admin are automatically removed after 1 hour to not add to your usage quota.
    5. **Troubleshoot the Results**: Use the quiz's [built-in search tool](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) in the `Responses` section to understand why specific products were recommended or missing from the recommendations. 
        ![how to recommend products built for shopify revenuehunt app troubleshoot results](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_responses_sample1_checkproduct.png)
        !!! tip
            Check [How to Troubleshoot Quiz Results](/how-to-guides/troubleshoot-product-results/) for detailed instructions on how to use this tool.
    6. **Refine the Results**: If you want to make the results ultra-precise, you can also:
        - **Limit the recommendations**: You can choose to limit the recommendations to only show products that received X votes or more in the [Results Page settings](/how-to-guides/only-recommend-products-with-minimum-votes/).
        - **Use Exclusions**: You can use [Exclusions](#exclusion) to make sure that unwanted products are not shown (even if they were upvoted in another choice earlier).
    By linking product variants and collections to quiz choices, and understanding the inclusion/exclusion logic, you can use our algorithm to offer precise product recommendations.

    !!! warning "Not recommended for personality-type quizzes"
        Not recommended for personality-type quizzes due to complexity. For this application, try the [üéØ Custom Scoring System (Most Voted Variable)](/how-to-guides/set-up-scoring-quiz/) or [üß© Fixed Recommendations with Display Logic](/how-to-guides/set-up-fixed-recommendations-quiz/) solutions.
    Follow these steps to set up a funnel quiz with custom text blocks in the `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app:
    **Step 1: Understand Recommendation Mechanism**
    Our product recommendation algorithm works like a voting system:
    - Products are linked to each choice
    - When a customer picks a choice, all linked products receive one vote
    - After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted products sorted by the number of votes
    - If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty
    - If there's a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the order of products
    **Step 2: Build Quiz Structure**
    1. Go to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and create all questions needed. Add all possible choices for each question.
    **Step 3: Link Products to Choices**
    1. For each choice open Choice Settings and add products to "Upvote" section.
    2. The quiz will count votes from all questions
    **Step 4: Configure Results Page**
    1. Add a Products Block with "Based on customer's responses" setting for Recommendations System.
    2. Add multiple Sections to your results page for different answer combinations. To each section add text, images or HTML content blocks for different answer combinations.
    **Step 5: Set Up Display Logic**
    1. For each content block:
        - Add display logic rules in block settings. Format: If the answer to *Question 1* is *Choice A* **AND** If the answer to *Question 2* is *Choice B* **AND** If the answer to *Question 3* is *Choice C* **OR** If the answer to *Question 1* is *Choice A* **AND** If the answer to *Question 2* is *Choice B* **AND** If the answer to *Question 3* is *Choice D*, then this block is **shown/hidden**.
        - Combine conditions with AND/OR operators.
        - Example: If "Skin Type" is "Oily" **AND** "Main Concern" is "Acne", show this block.
    2. Cover all possible answer combinations!
    **Step 6: Test and Launch**
    1. Save changes
    2. Test thoroughly! Try different answer combinations. Verify correct content appears. Check product recommendations.
    3. Use [Response Analysis](/how-to-guides/troubleshoot-product-results/) to verify logic and check product recommendations.

## ‚úçüèª Voting System


Recommended for most quizzes. The voting system counts product "votes" based on customer quiz choices and recommends products with the highest votes.

!!! note "Use this method for:"  

    - Helping customers narrow down a large product catalog
    - Most quizzes, especially product finders
    - Your first product recommendation quiz
    - Quizzes without complex branching

### Funnel Quiz

The voting system counts product "votes" based on customer quiz choices and recommends products with the highest votes.

![how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_funnel](/images/how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_funnel.png){width=500}

Product recommendation algorithm works like a voting system:

- Product variants are linked to each choice.
- When a customer picks a choice, all linked products receive one vote.
- After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted product variants sorted by the number of votes. *If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty. If there's a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the order of products.*
- You can limit recommendations to a specific number of products or a minimum vote threshold.

### Funnel Quiz with Slots

The voting system counts product "votes" based on customer quiz choices and then recommends highest voted products based on a filter added to each slot. For example, you can recommend a full skincare routine with a quiz that takes into account the customer answers and shows the most voted cleanser, toner, serum and moisturizer arranged into specific slots.

    Custom scores or variables can be assigned to choices in the quiz in order to set up a scoring quiz, personality type quiz, dosha quiz, etc.
    To add scores or variables to choices, follow these steps:
    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add your `Multiple choice questions` asking the customer about their needs. For example: age, skincondition, etc. if you are building a quzi that determines a skin type.
    2. Open the [Choice Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings).
    3. Find the `Scores and calculations` section.
    4. You can adjust the pre-made 'score' variable for each choice with the up/down arrows. You can assign negative values if needed
        ![how to add scores or variables to choices](https://loom.com/i/8180f5a1dd8c48a894ac3a6300bd7fe4?workflows_screenshot=true)
        !!! example
            - For choice one, set the score to 1.
            - For choice two, set the score to 2.
            - For choice three, set the score to 3.
    5. To create a new variable, click on the `Search or create variable` search bar and start typing the name of the variable you want to create (e.g. `dry skin` or `variable1`). 
    6. Once you've typed the full name, a dropdown will appear that will allow you to `Create a new variable "xxx"`. Click on it to add a new variable.
        ![how to add scores or variables to choices](https://loom.com/i/7b28b691b0e8451dadaaab68807ae51f?workflows_screenshot=true)
    7. Once a new variable is created, you can assign a score to it.
    8. Repeat the process for each choice in that question and move on to the next question in your quiz.

    Let's imagine you are creating a quiz for a skin care brand. You want to know which skin type the customer has.
    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add your `Multiple choice questions` asking the customer about their skin condition. For example: itchiness, tightness, dryness, etc. if you are creating a quiz for a skin care brand.
    2. **Assign Variables and Scores to Choices**: Go to each question in your quiz. For each choice, open the [choice settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings) and [assign varibales to each choice](/how-to-guides/set-up-scoring-quiz/#how-to-add-scores-or-variables-to-choices). 
        !!! tip
            To learn how to add scores or variables to choices, check out this guide: [How to Add Scores or Variables to Choices](/how-to-guides/set-up-scoring-quiz/#how-to-add-scores-or-variables-to-choices).
        !!! example
            Question 1: How does your skin feel when you wake up in the morning?
            - Choice 1: Tight (variable `dry skin` +1)
            - Choice 2: Normal (variable `normal skin` +1)
            - Choice 3: Oily (variable `oily skin` +1)
            - Choice 4: Combination (variable `combination skin` +1)
            - Choice 5: Sensitive (variable `sensitive skin` +1)  
            Question 2: How does your skin usually look by midday?
            - Choice 1: Still tight (variable `dry skin` +1)
            - Choice 2: Same as in the morning (variable `normal skin` +1)
            - Choice 3: Shiny (variable `oily skin` +1)
            - Choice 4: T-zone shiny (variable `combination skin` +1)
            - Choice 5: Red and irritated (variable `sensitive skin` +1)
    3. **Add a Results Page and Sections**: Add a [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) to your quiz. On the Results Page add several **Sections** with Heading, Text and Product Block that shows products for specific skin type and its challenges.
        !!! example
            Section 1: Dry Skin
            Section 2: Normal Skin
            Section 3: Oily Skin
            Section 4: Combination Skin 
            Section 5: Sensitive Skin
    4. **Add a Product Block to Each Section**: Add a [Product Block](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections) to each section on your Results Page. In the Product Block settings set the `Recommendation System` to `Fixed Recommendations` and select the products you want to recommend for that skin type.  
    5. **Add Display Logic**: Add a [Display Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#display-logic-display-section-logic) to each section on your Results Page to tell it when to be shown or hidden based on the winning variable.
        !!! example
            - If the variable with the highest score is `dry skin`, then Section 1 is **visible**. Otherwise Default visibility is **hidden**.
            - If the variable with the highest score is `normal skin`, then Section 2 is **visible**. Otherwise Default visibility is **hidden**.
            - If the variable with the highest score is `oily skin`, then Section 3 is **visible**. Otherwise Default visibility is **hidden**.
            - If the variable with the highest score is `combination skin`, then Section 4 is **visible**. Otherwise Default visibility is **hidden**.
            - If the variable with the highest score is `sensitive skin`, then Section 5 is **visible**. Otherwise Default visibility is **hidden**.
    6. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz.

    2. **Assign Scores to Choices**: Go to each question in your quiz. For each choice, open the choice settings and [assign appropriate point values to each choice](/how-to-guides/set-up-scoring-quiz/#how-to-add-scores-or-variables-to-choices) via the [Choice Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings) section. 
        ![assigning scores to choices](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_scoringquiz_addscore.png)
        !!! tip
            To learn how to add scores or variables to choices, check out this guide: [How to Add Scores or Variables to Choices](/how-to-guides/set-up-scoring-quiz/#how-to-add-scores-or-variables-to-choices).
        !!! example
            For example, with skin type questions:
            - Dry skin choices: 1 point
            - Normal skin choices: 2 points
            - Oily skin choices: 3 points
            - Combination skin choices: 4 points
            - Sensitive skin choices: 5 points
    2. **Add Content Sections to Results Page**: Go to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) and add a new `sections`. To add a new section click the `+ Add section` sign. 
        Add multiple content blocks describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:
        ![how to hide content with logic shopifyv2 display logic sections](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_display_logic_sections.png)
        !!! example
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness ‚Äì we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that‚Äôs deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn‚Äôt experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin‚Äôs natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
        To each block add a `Product Block` with the products you want to recommend for that skin type. Make sure to set the `Recommendation System` to `Fixed Recommendations` in the [Product Block Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections).  
        ![how_to_shopifyv2_scoringquiz_fixedrecommendations](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_scoringquiz_fixedrecommendations.png)
    3. **Add Score-Based Display Logic**: On the Results Page, select a content block and in the right-hand menu locate `Display logic`.
        - Click on `+ Add condition (OR)`
        - Instead of using question-specific conditions, use the `The varaible with the highest score...` or `The score of the varaible...` option
        - Set up range conditions to control when each content block should be visible/hidden.
        ![score-based display logic](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_scoringquiz_displaylogic.png)

            - Normal skin content: Total score is between 8-12 points
            - Oily skin content: Total score is between 13-17 points
            - Combination skin content: Total score is between 18-22 points
            - Sensitive skin content: Total score is between 23-25 points

    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add your `Multiple choice questions` asking the customer about their needs. For example: age, skin type, enviornemnet etc. if you are creating a quiz for a skin care brand.
    2. **Assign Scores to Choices**: Go to each question in your quiz. For each choice, open the choice settings and [assign appropriate point values to each choice](/how-to-guides/set-up-scoring-quiz/#how-to-add-scores-or-variables-to-choices) via the [Choice Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings) section. 
        !!! tip
            To learn how to add scores or variables to choices, check out this guide: [How to Add Scores or Variables to Choices](/how-to-guides/set-up-scoring-quiz/#how-to-add-scores-or-variables-to-choices).
        ![assigning scores to choices](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_scoringquiz_addscore.png)
        !!! example
            For example, with skin type questions:
            - Dry skin choices: 1 point
            - Normal skin choices: 2 points
            - Oily skin choices: 3 points
            - Combination skin choices: 4 points
            - Sensitive skin choices: 5 points
    3. **Create Multiple Results Pages**: Go to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) section and click `+ Add Results Page` to create additional results pages. Create one results page for each possible outcome.
        ![how_to_shopifyv2_scoringquiz_multiresultspages](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_scoringquiz_multiresultspages.png)
        !!! example
            For example:
            - Results Page 1: Dry Skin Routine
            - Results Page 2: Normal Skin Routine
            - Results Page 3: Oily Skin Routine
            - Results Page 4: Combination Skin Routine
            - Results Page 5: Sensitive Skin Routine
    3. **Add Content to Each Results Page**: For each results page, addustom text describing the specific skin type and its challenges, product recommendations for that skin type and any additional content blocks relevant to that skin type.
        To each results page add a section with content describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:
        ![how to hide content with logic shopifyv2 display logic sections](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_display_logic_sections.png)
        !!! example
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness ‚Äì we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that‚Äôs deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn‚Äôt experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin‚Äôs natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
        Make sure to add product blocks to each results page and set the `Recommendation System` to `Fixed Recommendations` in the [Product Block Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections).
        ![how_to_shopifyv2_scoringquiz_fixedrecommendations](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_scoringquiz_fixedrecommendations.png) 
    4. **Set Up Jump Logic Based on Scores**: Go to the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) section of Quiz Builder. Find the last question in your quiz and open the [Jump Logic settings](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic):
        - Click on `+ Add condition (OR)`
        - Select `The variable with the highest score...` or `The score of the variable...` option
        - Set up range conditions to control which results page the user will be directed to
        ![how_to_shopifyv2_scoringquiz_multiresultspages_logic](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_scoringquiz_multiresultspages_logic.png)
        !!! example

# How to Show Quiz Answers in the Shopify Orders

It's possible to know exactly which orders in your Shopify Orders tab come from the quiz.

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

1. Make sure your quiz is connected to [Shopify Customers](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-shopify-customers/) and that you've [enabled Order Notes](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/themes-by-shopify/vintage-themes/customizing-vintage-themes/get-more-information-with-order-notes) in your Shopify Theme.
    2. Shopify Orders Tagging option will be automatically connected when you connect the quiz to Shopify Customers.
    3. Make sure to `Save` the quiz change afterwards.
    From that moment all the orders under the Shopify Orders list will display a small `Notes` section with the tags related to the quiz.
    ![how to show quiz answers on orders example1](/images/how_to_show_quiz_answers_on_orders_example1.png)
    You can freely edit the content of that section by clicking `Edit` and adding your changes.
    ![how to show quiz answers on orders example3](/images/how_to_show_quiz_answers_on_orders_example3.png)
    !!! warning
        Some Shopify themes disable the passing of tags to the orders. These themes should have the option to activate this feature in the theme settings manually.
    !!! warning
        Shopify Revenue Tracking and Orders Tagging only works if the customer adds the products to the cart directly from the quiz results page **AND** if they immediately proceed to the cart after the quiz, and then right away complete the purchase. If they purchase at a later date, this revenue will not be attributed to the quiz anymore.
        Make sure your Results Page Checkout settings are correctly set to `proceed to cart` (not `proceed to checkout` or `link to product`). To change your checkout settings, check [this guide](/how-to-guides/change-checkout-settings/).
    If you believe the orders tagging is not working as it should, try to following steps:
    1. Go to the `Connect` tab and disconnect the quiz from **Shopify Customers**. Then, publish the changes with the top-right `S  ave` button. 
    2. Connect the quiz again to Shopify Customers and (again) publish the changes with the top-right `Save` button. That should reset the connection.
    3. Use a different browser or incognito browsing mode to open the live quiz on your site (don't test on preview/admin.revenuehunt).
    4. Take the quiz all the way to the results, provide the same email in the quiz that will be used for checkout/placing an order. Good idea is using *yourrealemail+test1@youremail.com* for example. 
    5. Add all the products to cart and proceed to cart, then checkout.
    6. Place a valid test order (as explained [here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/checkout-settings/test-orders)).
    7. Check if the lead was added to **Shopify Customers** section and if it was marked with `RevenueHunt` in the details.
    8. Go to **Shopify Orders** and check if the order notes appear along the test order placed. 
    If you're still having issues, please reach out to our [support team](/how-to-guides/contact-customer-support/).

# How to Show a Quiz Based on Shopify Markets

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

This article explains how to show a quiz based on Shopify Markets.
    With RevenueHunt Quizzes app, you can show a different quiz to users from different markets and languages.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 53.125%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c0exzYPtydo?si=qKfPEBhJ2RvMlgBz" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    !!! tip "Tutorial"
        Check our step by step tutorial on how to set up Shopify Markets and assign quizzes to different markets and languages with the RevenueHunt app: [Assign Quizzes to Shopify Markets and Languages](/tutorials/shopify-markets/).
    To start, make sure you have [Shopify Markets](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/international/managing) enabled and cofigured in your Shopify store. In order to show a quiz in a differnt currency or language, you first need to have a market configured in your Shopify store for these currencies or languages.
    !!! example "Example"
        If you have a market configured for Europe with the `EUR` currency, you can show a quiz in that market. 
        If you have a market configured for the US with the `USD` currency, you can show a quiz in that market.
        If you have a market in Spanish with the `ES` language, you can show a quiz in Spanish for that market.
        If you market in France with the `FR` language, you can show a quiz in French for that market.
    Go to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and create a new quiz. 
    To create a quiz in a different languege, duplicate the quiz from the dashbaord and edit the quiz. 
    ![manual_shopifyV2_quizmanagementoptions](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizmanagementoptions.png)
    The quiz doesn't have an automatic translstaion option, so you will have to transalte all the questions and answers manually. The text of buttons and admin messages can be translated in the [Quiz Settings > Quiz Content](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#messages-quiz-content) section.  
    ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizsettings_quizcontent](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizsettings_quizcontent.png)
    You can create as many quizzes as you want, each in a different language.
    Once all your quizzes in different languages are created, head over to [App Settings > Shopify Markets](/reference/app-settings/#shopify-markets). This section contains all the markets and langueges you've set up in your Shopify store.
    ![manual_shopifyV2_appsettings_markets](/images/manual_shopifyV2_appsettings_markets.png)
    Select which quiz should be the default quiz shown for each market.
    ![manual_shopifyV2_appsettings_markets_pickquiz](/images/manual_shopifyV2_appsettings_markets_pickquiz.png)
    Click on `Show ALL locales` to set up a different default quiz for each languge and market specifically.
    ![manual_shopifyV2_appsettings_markets_showall](/images/manual_shopifyV2_appsettings_markets_showall.png)
    In there, you can also change format of how the price currency on recommended product is displayed. If you don't change the default, the price will be displayed as set up in your Shopify Market. If you want to change the format type the currency in the format you want, for example `${{amount}}` or `{{amount}}‚Ç¨` can be used to replace the default `{{amount}}USD` or `{{amount}}EUR`.
    Save the changes. From now on, the default quiz for your store will open. If you've configured [Shopify Markets](/reference/app-settings/#shopify-markets), the default quiz for that specific market will be shown instead.
    To test that the right quiz is shown for the right market, ensure that the quiz is published on your website by following the instructions in the [Publish](/reference/quiz-builder/share-publish/) tab of the app or [this how to article](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/publish-quiz/).
    Then navigate to your website and change the languge or region to see if the right quiz is shown for that market.
    !!! warning
        The `Preview` option in the quiz builder always displays the default quiz in the default main market. It is not yet possible to preview the quiz in a different market within the app. To test the quiz in a different market, you need to publish the quiz on your website and then change the languge or region to see if the right quiz is shown for that market.

# How to Show Quiz in Shop App

!!! warning

    Shopify has announced that they‚Äôll be sunsetting all Shop Minis app integrations, including our Shop Minis app.

Shopify's new mobile commerce app, [Shop](https://shop.app/), represents a significant leap forward in enhancing the online shopping experience, offering both Android and iOS users a personalized and streamlined path to discovering and purchasing products from Shopify-powered stores. 

We're excited to inform you that our [RevenueHunt app](https://revenuehunt.com/product-recommendation-quiz-shopify/) has been selected as the **premier quiz solution** for Shop, designed to integrate seamlessly and contribute to a more engaging customer journey.

## Availability and Automatic Integration

Initially, the integration of the RevenueHunt Product Recommendation QUiz will be available to a select group of merchants. We are working towards making this feature broadly available to all eligible merchants soon.

For merchants who meet specific criteria, the Shop App feature will be enabled automatically, making the integration process hassle-free:

!!! info "Eligibility Criteria for Automatic Activation"

    - Your quiz recommends products listed for sale in the Shop app.
    - The quiz does not require an email address as a mandatory field. Optional email collection is permitted.
    - Your quiz does not include a phone number collection question, in line with Shop's guidelines.

## Managing Your Quiz in Shop app

If the Shop App feature has not been activated for your store automatically, you can manually set it up through the [App Settings](/reference/app-settings/). 

1. **Open App Settings**: Navigate to the [`Shop App`](/reference/app-settings/#shop-app-beta) menu within the [App settings](/reference/app-settings/#shop-app-beta) to get started.
  ![how to show quiz in shop app settings](/images/manual_appsettings_shopapp_preview.png)
2. **Select Quiz**: To control which quiz is presented to your customers in the Shop app, simply select your preferred quiz from the dropdown menu. The selected quiz will automatically be set as the default for display in the Shop app.
3. **Mark as default**: The quiz that appears in your Shop store is the one **marked as default**. You can easily identify the default quiz by looking for a small star icon in the top right corner of the quiz's icon on the dashboard. 
    
    ![how to show quiz in shop app select quiz](/images/how_to_show_quiz_in_shop_app_select_quiz.webp)
    
4. **Change default quiz**: To set a quiz as the default, use the quizzes dropdown menu on the dashboard.
    
    ![how to show quiz in shop app mark as default](/images/how_to_show_quiz_in_shop_app_mark_as_default.webp)


!!! warning

    We strive to offer a seamless and comprehensive user experience with the Shop App integration. However, it's important to note that currently, the **collection of phone numbers via the Shop app quiz is not supported**. We are actively working to include this feature in the near future.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/2b244cde228e450c9908aed5459b99f2?sid=ab8b600e-5464-4c0a-b982-5a1e5627c994" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    While our [product recommendation algorithm](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/) works to recommend specific products, it will not automatically display an explanation text of **why** a certain product was recommended. It also won‚Äôt *automatically* display custom text depending on the recommended product. 
    However, there are a few easy ways to show such a custom result text/explanation with the new Built for Shopify version of the RevenueHunt app.
    - The new Built for Shopify version of the RevenueHunt app allows you to set up different section on the results page with different text + product recommendations combinations. 
    - You can then use the [Display Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#display-logic) feature to tell each section when to be shown or hidden based on a customer answers, variable or a score.  
    - For this reason, it can be very easy to build a **"personality-type"** or **Dosha** quiz with our Built for Shopify solution.
    !!! info
        To learn how to **use Display Logic** to show different sections on the results page, check [this guide](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/).
        You can also check [this guide](/how-to-guides/set-up-scoring-quiz/#winning-variable-quiz) on settings up a quiz with the winning variable or [this guide](/how-to-guides/set-up-scoring-quiz/#scoring-quiz-with-one-results-page) on how to set up a quiz with a custom scoring system.

# How to Run a Catalog Sync

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

If you're missing products or collections in the loaded list within the new Built for Shopify version of the RevenueHunt app, you can run a catalog import from the app's dashboard.
    This article will guide you through troubleshooting and syncing your product catalog with the RevenueHunt app.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/804b7fa1515f4c55b9099322c519a1f9?sid=dadcfd7a-8a2a-4af6-a0bf-6057c27ad996" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    In the `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app, your product catalog is synced in real time, so there's typically no need to run a manual sync.
    However, if you need to force a catalog sync:
    1. **Navigate to App Settings:** Go to [App Settings > Catalogue](/reference/app-settings/#catalogue).
    2. **Initiate Manual Sync:** Click the `Import catalogue` button to trigger a manual sync.
    The real-time sync feature ensures your products and collections are always up to date, making manual syncs generally unnecessary.
    !!! info "Important"
        Our app automatically syncs your store's catalog every 24 hours and whenever changes are made in your store's catalog. This includes updates to products, collections, tags, variants, and vendors.
    - Your product catalog syncs **in real time**, so changes you make to your products or collections in Shopify are immediately reflected in the RevenueHunt app.
    - Only products marked as **active** will be synced with the app and appear in dropdown choices. 
    - **Archived products are excluded** from the sync and will not be visible.
    - **Draft products are included** in the sync and will be visible in the app unless you change your [Catalogue Settings](/reference/app-settings/#catalogue) to exclude draft products.
    - The automatic real-time sync ensures your catalog is always up to date without manual intervention.
    - In rare cases where you need to force a sync, you can use the `Import catalogue` button in [App Settings > Catalogue](/reference/app-settings/#catalogue).
    - **Verify Product Status:** If products aren't appearing, check that they are set to "Active" status in your Shopify store.
    - **Force a Manual Sync:** If real-time updates aren't reflecting, try using the `Import catalogue` button in [App Settings > Catalogue](/reference/app-settings/#catalogue) to force a complete sync.
    - **Contact Support:** If problems persist after trying a manual sync, please [contact our support team](/how-to-guides/contact-customer-support/) for assistance.
    The feature is not needed. App syncs only the products you chose to use in the quiz.

# How to Troubleshoot Product Recommendations in Your Quiz

Navigating through the product recommendations can be challenging, especially when dealing with numerous products and collections/categories linked to quiz choices. 

This guide will walk you through the process of troubleshooting product recommendations. It can help you understand why a certain product was recommended or missing from the Results Page.

!!! warning "Understanding the basics"

    When a particular product appears (or fails to appear) on the Results Page, it's crucial to understand the mechanism behind its selection. This involves tracing back to the quiz responses and analyzing the [voting system](/how-to-guides/set-up-funnel-quiz/#voting-system) or [display logic](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#display-logic-display-section-logic) that influences product visibility.

## Step-by-Step Process to Check Recommendations

!!! tip

    Before you begin, open the [Responses section](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) from the [App manual](/reference/) in the new browser window. It will come in handy.

    1. **Explore Responses**: To open the responses sections, go back to the [dashboard](/reference/quiz-builder/). Pick a quiz and click the `...` to open the quiz menu. From the list pick and click on [`Responses`](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses).
        ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_openresponses](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_openresponses.png)
        In the Responses section you will find a list of the latest quiz responses sorted by date. Click on a date to open a specific response.
        ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_responses](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_responses.png)
        !!! warning "Test responses removal"
            Admin responses and quiz previews are removed from the list after 24 hours to don't add to your plan's limits.
    2. Check the `Why was a product recommended or not in this response?` section. This section of the app allows you to troubleshoot individual responses and understand why certain products were recommended to the customer or missing from the recommendations.
        ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_responses_sample1](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_responses_sample1.png)
    3. On the results page, identify a product of interest‚Äîeither one that appeared unexpectedly on the Results Page or one you anticipated but was missing.
    4. **Conduct a Product Search**: Use the `SELECT PRODUCT TO CHECK` section to search the name of the product in question. Select the product from the search results to further investigate its recommendation status.
        **Understanding Product Status Colors**
        - **Green**: Indicates products that received votes through the quiz choices.
        - **Red**: Denotes products that were explicitly excluded from recommendations.
        - **White**: Represents products that did not receive any votes, hence their absence from the recommendations.
    5. **Analyze Product Details**: Upon selecting a product, a detailed panel will reveal critical information.
        ![how to troubleshoot quiz results search products](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_responses_sample1_checkproduct.png)
        Information such as:
        - The collections/categories the product belongs to.
        - The number of votes it received and the reasons for its recommendation or absence.
        - The questions/choices that influenced its votes, including the collections/categories where it was either upvoted or excluded.
        - The specific Results Page and Slots or Product blocks that facilitated its recommendation.
    6. **Troubleshooting and Adjustments**: With this information, you can pinpoint inconsistencies or errors in product categorization, inclusion, or exclusion. 
    !!! tip
        A common issue is a product being **misclassified** into an incorrect collection/category or **accidentally excluded** in quiz settings. Paying close attention to these details can significantly improve the accuracy of your product recommendations.

# Troubleshooting Product Recommendation Quiz App Issues for WordPress / WooCommerce

Our Product Recommendation Quiz app is designed to integrate seamlessly with most e-commerce stores. However, due to the high level of customization in WordPress / WooCommerce stores, conflicts with other plugins or store settings can occasionally arise, impacting the app‚Äôs functionality. This guide aims to address common issues and provide clear solutions.

!!! tip "General Troubleshooting Tip"
    
    If you‚Äôve exhausted all listed solutions without success, it may be due to specific configurations in your website. In such cases, consult your developer or hosting provider and review server logs for potential clues. Unfortunately, our capacity to assist is limited in these scenarios.

!!! warning

    Important Addition: Ensure to whitelist our IP address (`3.14.55.225`) in your store‚Äôs settings to facilitate uninterrupted communication between our app and your store.

## Error #1: Request and Data Transmission Issues

!!! example "Error Messages"

    An error occurred in the request and at the time were unable to send the consumer data.

    We tried checking the connection with your WooCommerce API, but was unsuccessful.

    We tried fetching the product varaitions via the WooCommerce API, but was unsuccessful.

    We tried connecting to your WooCommerce API to sync the ‚Äúproducts, but got a status 403.

Possible Causes and Solutions:

1. **Outdated WooCommerce Version**: Ensure your store is running a version later than WooCommerce 3.5.
2. **Outdated Plugin Version**: Ensure you‚Äôve downloaded the latest version of the app.
3. **Lack of HTTPS/SSL Certificate**: Install and activate a valid certificate for secure API communication.
4. **Website Accessibility**: Remove password protection or ‚Äòcoming soon‚Äô plugins that restrict public access.
5. **Caching Plugin Interference**: Disable caching plugins one by one to identify the culprit.
6. **Server Configuration**: If the above don‚Äôt resolve the issue, your server might be stripping the ‚ÄúAuthorization‚Äù header.
7. **Check Security Settings**: Review your store‚Äôs and hosting security settings to ensure they aren‚Äôt conflicting with the app.
8. **Disable Other Plugins**: Temporarily deactivate other plugins and try granting access to our app to see if they are causing a conflict.
9. **Cloudflare Cache**: Exclude the WooCommerce API endpoint (/wp-json/wc/v3/) from Cloudflare‚Äôs cache. Alternatively, use Cloudflare‚Äôs developer mode to bypass the cache temporarily. (Source: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/)

![how to troubleshoot wordpress woocommerce image1](/images/how_to_troubleshoot_wordpress_woocommerce_image1.webp)

Advanced Solutions:

1. Review caching plugin settings related to headers.
2. Generate a new LetsEncrypt certificate.
3. Direct subdomain to bypass Cloudflare CDN Proxy.
4. Switch to a basic WooCommerce Theme like ‚ÄúStorefront‚Äù for initial connection.
5. Add to .htaccess: `SetEnvIf Authorization "(.*)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1`.

**Special Note**: If using CAFE24 hosting, disable the ‚ÄúSPAM Shield‚Äù function.

## Error #2: Authentication and Permission Issues

!!! example "Error Messages"

    It seems that something is interfering with your WordPress Rest API. This needs to be fixed in order to grant access to this plugin.

    Missing parameter app_name

    404 Not Found ‚Äì the requested URL was not found on this server

Possible Causes and Solutions:

1. **WPML or Polylang Plugin Conflict**: Temporarily deactivate WPML/Polylang, authenticate our plugin, then reactivate WPML/Polylang. (As of November 2024, Polylang and Product Recommendation Quiz app cannot be used together.)
2. **Incorrect Callback URL**: Replace `%2F` with `/` in the URL, or remove extra /wp/ from the URL.
3. **Installation Location**: For WooCommerce on a subpage, adjust the URL accordingly (remove /page/). So, instead of `https://yourstore.com/shop/wc-auth/v1/authorize/...` You would use `https://yourstore.com/wc-auth/v1/authorize/...` Even if the first URL is the right path to your WooCommerce store.
4. **Website is not live**: Ensure installation on a live, publicly accessible website. It cannot be hidden by an ‚Äúunder construction‚Äù plugin or setting. The app does not work in local environments.
5. **Check WordPress REST API**: To test it visit  `https://yourstore.com/wp-json/`. If you‚Äôre getting a ‚ÄúNot Found‚Äù or similar error, it‚Äôs possible that you need to fix your WordPress installation. It‚Äôs a problem with the WordPress REST API in your site and not with the WooCommerce REST API. You‚Äôll have to contact your developer to further investigate this issue as it‚Äôs outside of our scope.

!!! example "Error Messages"

    The following REST API endpoint is returning a valid JSON but the returned content-type is text/html instead of the expecred application/json.

Possible Causes and Solutions:

1. **Check JSON format**. This means that even if your site returns a JSON it may not be in the correct format. The WordPress API is returning a response that is encoded as text/html. Normally, it should be application/json.   This is related to your store or server settings, but can also be influenced by another plugin. It is recommended to check it with your developer and fix it.

![how to troubleshoot wordpress woocommerce image2](/images/how_to_troubleshoot_wordpress_woocommerce_image2.jpg)

!!! example "Error Messages"

    Plugin could not be activated because it triggered a fatal error. Fatal error: Cannot redeclare prq_set_token() (previously declared in‚Ä¶)

Possible Causes and Solutions:

1. **Duplicate Plugin Activation**: Deactivate the existing WordPress Plugin (Product recommendation Quiz for eCommerce) before activating the WooCommerce extension (Product Recommendation Quiz for WooCommerce). Don‚Äôt worry, you won‚Äôt lose any data because your quizzes and responses are stored in our server.

![how to troubleshoot wordpress woocommerce image3](/images/how_to_troubleshoot_wordpress_woocommerce_image3.png)

!!! example "Error Messages"

    The plugin does not have a valid header

Possible Causes and Solutions:

1. **Plugins cached**: Your list of Plugins could be cached in whatever WP Object Cache your blog / site is using. (Source: [https://scotty-t.com/2011/03/28/fix-for-the-plugin-does-not-have-a-valid-header/](https://scotty-t.com/2011/03/28/fix-for-the-plugin-does-not-have-a-valid-header/))
2. **Check the Correct Folder Structure**: Ensure that the plugin‚Äôs main file is placed correctly in the wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. **Modify PHP File Headers**: If the headers of PHP files within the plugin resemble the mandatory header of the main plugin file, it can confuse WordPress. Modifying these headers to a different format can resolve the issue. (Source: [https://chattymango.com/how-fix-wordpress-error-plugin-not-valid-header/](https://chattymango.com/how-fix-wordpress-error-plugin-not-valid-header/))
4. **Remove /trunk directory**: Remove `/trunk` directory or activate from the plugin list. (Source: [https://wordpress.org/support/topic/the-plugin-does-not-have-a-valid-header-solution/](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/the-plugin-does-not-have-a-valid-header-solution/))
5. **Outdated Plugin Version**: Ensure you‚Äôve downloaded the latest version of the app.
6. **Two Plugins Installed**: Deactivate and remove the WooCommerce extension before installing the WordPress plugin (or vice versa).

# How to Update Your Shopify Cart Drawer Products After the Quiz

If your quiz is adding products to the cart but your cart drawer isn‚Äôt updating or opening automatically, the issue is likely with how your Shopify theme handles cart updates ‚Äî not with the quiz itself.

This guide explains:

- How RevenueHunt quiz app adds products to the Shopify cart

- Why the cart drawer may not update

- What your theme editor or developer can do to fix it

## Step 1: Understand How Quiz Adds Products to the Cart

Our app uses Shopify‚Äôs official AJAX Cart API to add products. These are the same endpoints used by most Shopify themes and apps.

We use:

- `cart/add.js` ‚Äì adds products to the cart

- `cart/change.js` ‚Äì changes product quantities

- `cart/update.js` ‚Äì updates the cart with new contents

- `cart.js` ‚Äì retrieves the latest state of the cart

These actions notify Shopify that the cart has changed. It‚Äôs then up to the theme to update the UI, such as opening or refreshing the cart drawer.

## Step 2: Confirm If Your Theme Supports Cart Drawer Updates

Most modern themes (like Dawn) include a cart drawer or slide-out cart. However, if your cart drawer does not update after a quiz submission:

- Your theme is likely not listening for changes triggered by AJAX cart actions.

- This can happen even in Shopify‚Äôs default themes if the cart drawer script wasn‚Äôt customized or extended properly.

## Step 3: Talk to Your Theme Developer

Since our app only triggers Shopify‚Äôs standard cart actions, you‚Äôll need to make sure your theme is set up to respond to those actions.

Share the following resources with your developer or Shopify Expert:

- Shopify AJAX Cart Documentation: [https://shopify.dev/docs/api/ajax/reference/cart](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/ajax/reference/cart)

- Helpful guide on listening to AJAX cart events in Shopify themes: [https://www.perplexity.ai/search/how-to-get-shopify-theme-to-li-whWrlpOyT_6ygEG0ZRt68w#0](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/how-to-get-shopify-theme-to-li-whWrlpOyT_6ygEG0ZRt68w#0)


## Step 4: Test Your Setup

Once your theme is updated to listen to the AJAX cart actions, test the following:

1. Complete your quiz and click ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù.

2. Confirm that:

    - Products are added successfully.

    - The cart drawer opens automatically, or

    - The cart UI updates with the new products.


!!! info "Note"

    We do **not** modify your cart drawer or theme layout.

    We **cannot** support theme customization or debug third-party JavaScript.

    We‚Äôre happy to confirm that our app is triggering the correct cart actions ‚Äî [just let us know](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/contact-customer-support/).

    For theme modifications, please consult your theme developer or Shopify Expert.

# BigCommerce: Use Custom Fields as tags

You can create a Custom Field called ‚Äútags‚Äù within your BigCommerce store and use it to automaticaly group products within the Product Recommendation Quiz. These Custom Fields/tags can be then used to link products in bulk to choices or slots in the quiz.

Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. Navigate to your product page in BigCommerce and add open the `Custom Fields` menu.
    ![Use_Custom_Fields_as_tags_image1.jpg](/images/Use_Custom_Fields_as_tags_image1.jpg)
2. Next, select `+ Add custom fields` to create a new entry.
    ![Use_Custom_Fields_as_tags_image2.jpg](/images/Use_Custom_Fields_as_tags_image2.jpg)
3. In the Custom Field Name type ‚Äútags‚Äù and under Custom Field Value add the tags separated by a coma.
    ![Use_Custom_Fields_as_tags_image3.jpg](/images/Use_Custom_Fields_as_tags_image3.jpg)
4. Make sure to save the changes. You can tag many products in your store this way. 
5. Once you‚Äôre done tagging the products with the custom field called ‚Äútags‚Äù, simply run a [manual sync](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/) of the app to make sure the Product Recommendation Quiz catalog is up to date. Products with the same tags will be automatically grouped together within the app and you‚Äôll be able to link them to choices in the quiz within the [Link Categories/Tags](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/) section.

# How to Add and Use Customer Tags

Effective audience segmentation can dramatically improve the results of your marketing campaigns, and **customer tags** are a powerful tool for achieving this. 

This article will guide you through adding customer tags to choices, using customer tags to segment your audience, and improving your marketing strategies. 

By adding customer tags into your quizzes, you can automatically send quiz results to your mailing list or CRM, enabling precise segmentation based on customer responses.


!!! tip "Why Use Customer Tags?"

    Understanding the value of each member of your audience is crucial. While accumulating a large following on social media or a lengthy email list may seem beneficial, its true value comes into question if you know nothing about the individuals that make up those numbers.

    **The Importance of Segmentation**

    - **FACT 1:** Campaigns that are **highly segmented** can yield more than three times the revenue per recipient compared to unsegmented campaigns.
    - **FACT 2:** Ideally, your business should earn at least $1 per month for each subscriber. If this isn't the case, it indicates that your email list isn't segmented sufficiently.

    Segmentation allows for more personalized marketing strategies. By segmenting your audience based on specific criteria like specific customer tags, you can target them more effectively with tailored content and offers.

    By adding customer tags into your quizzes, you can automatically send quiz results to your mailing list or CRM, enabling precise segmentation based on customer responses.


## How to Add Customer Tags to Your Quiz

    1. **Navigate to the Quiz Builder**: Open your quiz in the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-builder/) by clicking `Customize`.
    2. **Access choice settings**: Click on any choice in your quiz to open its settings panel.
    3. **Add customer tags**: In the choice settings, find the `Customer Tags` section. 
        - Use the search bar to search for existing tags or create new ones. 
        - Type the tag name and press `Create new tag` to create it. 
        - You can add multiple tags to a single choice.
        ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_customertags](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_customertags.png)
        !!! tip
            If you want all the quiz takers to have a specific tag, you can add it to the all the choices in one of the questions in the quiz. This way no matter which choice they select, they will have the tag.
    4. **Save changes**: Click the "Save" button to apply your changes. Tags will be automatically applied to customers when they select the corresponding choice.
    5. **Preview the quiz**: Preview the quiz to verify that the tags have been added correctly to the quiz responses.
        !!! note
            Tags sent to responses will also be forwarded to any connected [integrations](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/).
            For example, if integrated with Shopify Customers List, customer tags will be sent to customer profiles in Shopify. If quiz is integrated with Klaviyo, customer tags will be sent to Klaviyo, etc.
    1. **Connecting Your Quiz:** Within the [Quiz Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/), find the [`Integrations`](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab. This section allows you to link your quiz with several third-party services, including [Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/), [Omnisend](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-omnisend/), and [Shopify Customers List](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-shopify-customers/). Integration with additional services is possible via [Webhooks](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-webhooks/).
    2. **Integration:** After choosing a service to connect, simply follow the provided instructions. This setup ensures that every time someone takes your quiz, their contact details, responses, customer tags and product recommendations are directly sent to your selected mailing list or CRM.
    3. **Using Segmented Data:** In your selected CRM, you can now [create segments based on the customer tags](/how-to-guides/use-customer-tags/#creating-segments-in-your-crm) and [send them targeted emails](#using-segmented-data) based on the quiz results.
    Once integrated, your CRM or mailing list will contain detailed segmented data on your customers. This enables you to create dynamic segments and direct hyper-targeted campaigns to different groups based on their quiz responses. 
    For example, users tagged with `dry_skin` can be targeted with a campaign promoting a specific moisurizing skincare product, while users tagged with `oily_skin` can be targeted with a campaign promoting a specific cleansing product.
    Instructions on how to create segments will vary per CRM platform but in general the segment definition will be similar to the following:
    !!! example "Example of a segment definition"
        If the value of the custom property `tags` contains `dry_skin` then the customer should be included in the segment.
    Any profile that has a tag will be included in the segment automatically.
    !!! warning
        In most integrations, tags are updated with every quiz retake. If you wish to preserve tags from each quiz attempt, [contacting support](/how-to-guides/contact-customer-support/) is recommended for further assistance.
    Once you've set up specific [segement in your CRM based on customer tags](/how-to-guides/use-customer-tags/#creating-segments-in-your-crm), you can use them to send targeted emails to your customers.
    1. Create email flows/campaigns specifically tailored to each segment. When designing tailored email campaigns, it‚Äôs all about crafting messages that really speak to each customer segment‚Äôs unique needs and preferences.
    2. Start by digging into the data from your customer tags to understand what makes each group tick. Create content that addresses their specific interests and personalize your subject lines and email bodies to make them feel valued. Plan your campaign schedule carefully to keep people engaged without overwhelming them, and use automation to send timely, relevant emails based on their behavior.
        !!! example
            - Curly Hair Segment: Send emails featuring products designed for curly hair, such as curl-enhancing shampoos and conditioners, and styling creams. Include tips for maintaining curly hair and exclusive offers on curl care bundles.
            - Dry Hair Segment: Send emails promoting moisturizing shampoos, conditioners, and deep-conditioning treatments. Share tips on how to combat dry hair and offer discounts on hydrating product sets.
    3. Use automation to send timely, relevant emails based on their behavior.

    With Display Logic you can make sections visible or hidden based on customer's responses.
    1. **Find a section**: Start by identifying or adding the section you wish to add Display Logic to. 
    2. **Open Display Logic settings**: Click on the section and on the right-hand side identify the `Display logic`.
        ![quiz builder results page block menu](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_displaylogic.png)
    3. Next, select `+ Add logic condition (OR)` to set up the first Display Logic rule.
        ---
        **Display logic operators**
        `+ Add condition (OR)` - Adds a new OR display logic rule.
        `+ Add condtion (AND)` - Adds a new AND logical statement to the same rule. AND conditional statements can be tricky, as both statements have to be true for the rule to take effect. For most quizzes, using the OR rule is enough.
        `bin` - Delete the current Logic rule.
        `+ Add condition (OR)` - Adds another Display Logic rule. Adds a new OR logical rule.
        `Default` - Select whether this section should be `Shown` or `Hidden` by default.
        ---
        There are three types of Display Logic rules you can choose from:
        ---
        **Type 1: IF The response to the question...**
        Then the Display Logic rules follow the following format:
        - **IF response to** pick the question from a dropdown list
        - **is**/ **is not** pick a choice from the dropdown list
        - **THEN section is Visible** 
        - **Default visibility** pick either **Visible** or **Hidden**. If Visible is selected, then section will be shown by default unless the Display Logic rule is triggered. If Hidden is selected, the section will be hidden by default unless the Display Logic rule is triggered.
        !!! example "Example 1"
            ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_displaylogic](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_displaylogic.png)
            In the example, if a user chooses a choice "Oily all over" in Question 4 "SKIN TYPE" then this section will be visible. If they give a different answer in Question 4 this content block will be hidden.
        ---
        **Type 2: IF The score of the variable...**
        Then the Display Logic rules follow the following format:
        - **IF The score of the variable** 
        - **score** pick the variable from a dropdown list
        - **is equal to**/ **is not equal to** / **is greater than**/ **is less than** / **is greater than or equal to** / **is less than or equal to** pick a choice from the dropdown list
        - **Number** / **Another variable** pick a choice from the dropdown list
        - **0** / **1** / **2** / **other numerical value** type a value in the input field
        - **THEN section is Visible** 
        - **Default visibility** pick either **Visible** or **Hidden**. If Visible is selected, then section will be shown by default unless the Display Logic rule is triggered. If Hidden is selected, the section will be hidden by default unless the Display Logic rule is triggered.
        !!! info
            Note: Scores are assigned to each choice in the [Questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions) tab > [Choice settings](/reference/quiz-builder/choice-settings) section.
        !!! example "Example 2"
            ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_displaylogic_scorerange](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_displaylogic_scorerange.png)
            In the example, if the score of the variable `dry` is greater than or equal to number `5` AND IF the score of the varaible `dry` is less than or equal to number `7` then this section will be visible. Otherwise, the section will be hidden.
        ---
        **Type 3: IF the variable with the highest score...**
        Then the Display Logic rules follow the following format:
        - **IF the variable with the highest score** 
        - **score** pick the variable from a dropdown list
        - **THEN section is Visible**
        - **Default visibility** pick either **Visible** or **Hidden**. If Visible is selected, then section will be shown by default unless the Display Logic rule is triggered. If Hidden is selected, the section will be hidden by default unless the Display Logic rule is triggered.
        !!! info
            Note: Scores are assigned to each choice in the [Questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions) tab > [Choice settings](/reference/quiz-builder/choice-settings) section.

    Custom scores or variables can be assigned to choices in the quiz in order to set up a scoring quiz, personality type quiz, dosha quiz, etc.
    To add scores or variables to choices, follow these steps:
    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add your `Multiple choice questions` asking the customer about their needs. For example: age, skincondition, etc. if you are building a quzi that determines a skin type.
    2. Open the [Choice Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/choice-settings/).
    3. Find the `Scores and calculations` section.
    4. You can adjust the pre-made 'score' variable for each choice with the up/down arrows. You can assign negative values if needed
        ![how to add scores or variables to choices](https://loom.com/i/8180f5a1dd8c48a894ac3a6300bd7fe4?workflows_screenshot=true)
        !!! example
            - For choice one, set the score to 1.
            - For choice two, set the score to 2.
            - For choice three, set the score to 3.
    5. To create a new variable, click on the `Search or create variable` search bar and start typing the name of the variable you want to create (e.g. `dry skin` or `variable1`). 
    6. Once you've typed the full name, a dropdown will appear that will allow you to `Create a new variable "xxx"`. Click on it to add a new variable.
        ![how to add scores or variables to choices](https://loom.com/i/7b28b691b0e8451dadaaab68807ae51f?workflows_screenshot=true)
    7. Once a new variable is created, you can assign a score to it.
    8. Repeat the process for each choice in that question and move on to the next question in your quiz.

    **Scenario**
    You want to show a section based on the customer's answer to a question. Imagine creating a quiz that determines a personalized skincare routine. *Question 4* might ask about the participant's skin type, and depending on the answer, a different text and recommendation about their skincare is shown on the Results Page. This individualized response is made possible by Display Logic.
    **Implementation**
    **Step 1: Add sections to the Results Page**
    The quiz has four sections on the Results Page for different skin types: Dry Skin, Normal Skin, Oily Skin, and Combination Skin. Without display logic, all sections would be visible at once.To show only one section based on user responses, display logic must be applied to each section.
    **Step 2: Configuring Display Logic for Dry Skin Section**
    1. *Find the Dry Skin Section*: Locate the section on the Results Page that corresponds to Dry Skin.
    2. *Open Display Logic Settings*: Click the `conditional logic / tree icon` button to open the Display Logic menu.
    3. *Add Display Logic Rule*: Select `+ Add logic condition (OR)` to create a new Display Logic rule.
    4. *Set Up the Rule*:
        - **If** `The response to question` - Choose the `question` that determines the skin type.
        - **is** - Select the choice that corresponds to `Dry Skin`.
        - **THEN section is VISIBLE**
        - Choose `Default visibility` to be `Hidden`.
        ![display logic example](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_answers_example1.png)
    **Step 3: Repeat the process for other skin types:** 
    - Normal Skin: Visible if the response is "not too oily and not too dry".
    - Oily Skin: Visible if the response is "oily all over".
    - Combination Skin: Visible if the response is "oily in certain spots".
    **Step 4: Preview and Adjust**
    Publish the changes with the top-right `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz and test the setup. Test by selecting different skin types to ensure only the relevant section is displayed.
    **Advanced Display Logic Conditions**
    You can set multiple conditions for display logic: 
    - Example: A section can be visible if the skin type is "dry and tight" or if the age group is "teens".
    - Another example: A section can be visible if both conditions are met: skin type is "dry and tight" and skin concerns include "acne".
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oORLg_BU0fI?si=G0PM__FcEyQJDtBp&amp;start=189" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    **Scenario**
    You're building a personality-type or Dosha quiz. You want to show a different text and product recommendations based on the winning variable. For examples, if the user chooses mostly A's, B's, C's, etc. a different section with different text and product recommendations is shown.
    **Implementation**
    **Step 1: Add Questions, Choices and Custom Variables**
    The quiz consists of five questions, each with five choices. Each choice is associated with a [custom variable and a score](#how-to-add-scores-or-variables-to-choices) via the [`Choices Settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings) section. 
    !!! tip
        To learn how to add scores or variables to choices, check out this guide: [How to Add Scores or Variables to Choices](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/#how-to-add-scores-or-variables-to-choices).
    Each answer contributes a score of +1 to the corresponding skin type variable: 
    - Dry skin: `dry +1`    
    - Normal skin: `normal +1`
    - Oily skin: `oily +1`
    - Combination skin: `combination +1`
    - Sensitive skin: `sensitive +1`
    ![how to shopifyv2 use display logic based on variable example1 scores](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_variable_example1_scores.png)
    This scoring will help determine the user's skin type based on their responses.
    **Step 2: Add Sections to the Results Page**
    The results page contains five sections, each corresponding to a skin type. Each section contains a heading, text and a product block to recommend products for that skin type.
    Each section can display recommended products in a [product block](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections) based on user responses or fixed recommendations: 
    - **Dynamic Recommendations:** Requires upvoting products via choice settings to influence the recommendation algorithm.
    - **Fixed Recommendations:** Set specific products to always display for each skin type section by changing the recommendation system to fixed and selecting items for each block. Ensure to configure fixed recommendations for all sections to provide consistent product suggestions.
    Change the `Recommendation System` in the [`Product Block Settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections) to whatever best suits your needs. For a personality-type quiz, we recommend using `Fixed Recommendations` and selecting products for each section.
    **Step 3: Add Display Logic to the Sections**
    To display the correct section based on the highest scoring variable, follow these steps: 
    1. Go to Section Settings, find `Display Logic` and click `+ Add condition (OR)`.
    2. Set up the rule like this:
        - **If** `The variable with the highest score` 
        - `is` - `dry` 
        - **THEN this section is VISIBLE**
        - Set the `Default visibility` to `Hidden`.
        ![how to shopifyv2 use display logic based on variable example1 display logic](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_variable_example1.png)
    3. For each skin type, set a similar rule for the visibility condition: 
        - If the highest score is `dry`, show the dry skin section.
        - If the highest score is `normal`, show the normal skin section.
        - If the highest score is `oily`, show the oily skin section.
        - If the highest score is `combination`, show the combination section.
        - If the highest score is `sensitive`, show the sensitive skin section.
    **Step 4: Save and Test the Setup**
    Publish the changes with the top-right `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz and click `Preview` to test the setup. Select answers that correspond to a specific skin type (e.g., mostly dry skin). Verify that the correct results section is displayed based on the selected answers.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oORLg_BU0fI?si=JG9rNnYpv1aqcdvO&amp;start=269" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    **Scenario**
    You're building a custom scoring or presonality-type quiz. You want to show a different text and product recommendations based on the score of a variable. For examples, if the user's score is above 50, a different section with different text and product recommendations is shown.
    **Implementation**
    **Step 1: Add Questions, Choices and Custom Variables**
    The quiz consists of five questions, each with five choices. Each choice is associated with a [custom score](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/#how-to-add-scores-or-variables-to-choices) via the [`Choices Settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings) section. 
    !!! tip
        To learn how to add scores or variables to choices, check out this guide: [How to Add Scores or Variables to Choices](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/#how-to-add-scores-or-variables-to-choices).
    Each answer contributes a score of +1 to the corresponding skin type variable: 
    - First choice: 1 point
    - Second choice: 2 points
    - Third choice: 3 points
    - Fourth choice: 4 points
    - Fifth choice: 5 points
    The total score helps determine the user's skin type based on their selections.
    ![how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_score_example1](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_score_example1.png)
    **Step 2: Add Sections to the Results Page**
    The results page contains five sections, each corresponding to a skin type. Each section contains a heading, text and a product block to recommend products for that skin type.
    Each section can display recommended products in a [product block](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections) based on user responses or fixed recommendations: 
    - **Dynamic Recommendations:** Requires upvoting products via choice settings to influence the recommendation algorithm.
    - **Fixed Recommendations:** Set specific products to always display for each skin type section by changing the recommendation system to fixed and selecting items for each block. Ensure to configure fixed recommendations for all sections to provide consistent product suggestions.
    Change the `Recommendation System` in the [`Product Block Settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections) to whatever best suits your needs. For a personality-type quiz, we recommend using `Fixed Recommendations` and selecting products for each section.      
    **Step 3: Add Display Logic to the Sections**
    To display the correct section based on the total score, follow these steps: 
    1. Go to Section Settings, find `Display Logic` and click `+ Add condition (OR)`.
    2. Set up the rule like this:
        - **If** `The score of a variable`  select the varaible `score` 
        - `is greater than or equal to` - `5`
        - **AND**
        - **IF** `The score of a variable`  select the varaible `score` 
        - `is less than or equal to` - `7`
        - **THEN this section is VISIBLE**
        - Set the `Default visibility` to `Hidden`.
        ![how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_score_example1_logic](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_score_example1_logic.png)
    3. For each skin type, set a similar rule for the visibility condition: 
        - Show  dry skin section if score is between 5 and 7 (inclusive). Condition: `score >= 5 && score <= 7`
        - Show normal skin section if score is between 8 and 12 (inclusive). Condition: `score >= 8 && score <= 12`
        - Show oily skin section if score is between 13 and 17 (inclusive). Condition: `score >= 13 && score <= 17`
        - Show combination skin section if score is between 18 and 22 (inclusive). Condition: `score >= 18 && score <= 22`
        - Show sensitive skin section if score is between 23 and 25 (inclusive). Condition: `score >= 23 && score <= 25`
    **Step 4: Save and Test the Setup**
    Publish the changes with the top-right `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz and click `Preview` to test the setup. Select answers that correspond to a specific skin type (e.g., mostly dry skin). Verify that the correct results section is displayed based on the selected answers.

# How to Use Information Recalls / Content Dynamic Source

Information recalls / Content Dynamic Source allow you to reuse participants' previously entered responses, such as their name or quiz answers, in subsequent questions, results pages, or follow-up communications. This personalizes the quiz experience by making it more relevant and engaging for the participant.

![how to use information recalls example filled](/images/how_to_use_information_recalls_example_filled.png)

## Adding Information Recalls / Content Dynamic Source

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/3c48487859ab403ab4af2d16588ff37f?sid=79951f9f-3e23-424f-9bb4-6963850b6e79" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    Content Dynamic Source allow you to recall any answer the customer provided in the quiz and used in any Text Block or a Heading Block on the results page.
    1. **Initiate Content Dynamic Source**: While crafting your quiz questions, results page or setting up follow-up communications, open the text or heading [`block settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings).
    2. To add an dynamic content source open a Text or a Headign block and click the Dynamic content source icon.
        ![how_to_resultspage_dynamiccontent](/images/how_to_resultspage_dynamiccontent.png)
        - Information Recalls cannot be added to the first question in the quiz.
    2. **Select From Available Data**: Upon triggering the dynamic source feature, a dropdown menu will appear, listing all available questions and data points collected from participants up to that point in the quiz. Scroll through the dropdown menu to find the specific piece of information you wish to recall. Whether it's the participant's name, their answers to previous questions, or other collected data, simply click on your choice to select it.
        ![how to use information recalls clicked](/images/how_to_resultspage_dynamiccontent2.png)
    3. **Implement Dynamic Source**: Once selected, the chosen data will be integrated into your current question, email subject line, or message body. Instead of seeing a generic placeholder, participants will see the recalled information, such as their name, making the interaction feel uniquely tailored to them.
        ![how to use information recalls example](/images/how_to_information_recalls_shopify_v2_example.png)
    Information recall / Content Dynamic Source can be used in various parts of your quiz to enhance personalization:
    - **Follow-up Questions:** Make your quiz feel more conversational by recalling the participant's name or other responses in later questions.
    - **Results Page:** Display personalized messages or recommendations on the results page by recalling the participant's name and answers.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N2gudKAy4qU?si=hcgIntH-XecaQxua" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    ![quiz builder conditional logic](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic.png)
    In the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab you can branch your quiz. The right menu allows you to add conditional logic rules to questions in the quiz. The left preview shows a logic tree of the quiz. Any branching you add will be reflected on the tree preview.
    By default, the quiz will progress from one question to another based on the question number. Conditional logic allows you to change this default behavior.
    ??? question "How to navigate the Conditional Logic tab?"
        ![quiz builder conditional logic preview options](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_zoom.png)
        **+** - Zoom in on the logic tree preview.
        **-** - Zoom out on the logic tree preview.
        **[]** - Center the logic tree preview and fit into view.
        üîí - Toggle interactivity. Lock or unlock the interactivaity of hte preview.
        Drag the logic tree with your mouse left button to navigate to specific branches.
    1. Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/).
    2. **Open Jump Logic**: Navigate to the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab and select [`Jump Logic`](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) section.
    3.  **Add Jump Logic**: Click `+ Add another rule` to add a new Jump Logic rule for the selected question. Here, you'll define your conditional statement using the template:
        - IF the response to `question X`
        - IS EQUAL TO `choice Y`
        - THEN go to `question Z`
        !!! example
            ![quiz builder conditional logic jump logic rule](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogic_example.png)
            In the example, if a user chooses a choice "Oily all over" in Question 4 "SKIN TYPE" then they will be redirected to Question 8 "SKIN TYPE: OILY".
    4. **Multiple Conditions:** You can add more than one Jump Logic rule to a single question by clicking on the big `+ Add another rule (OR)` button in the bottom right corner. This allows for complex paths that can direct participants to various follow-up questions based on their specific answers.
        - **+ Add another rule (OR)** - Add another Jump Logic rule. Adds a new OR logical rule.
            !!! example
                ![quiz builder conditional logic jump logic OR rule](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogic_exampleOR.png)
                In the example, if a user chooses a choice "Oily all over" in Question 4 "SKIN TYPE" then they will be redirected to Question 8 "SKIN TYPE: OILY" but if the user chooses a choice "Oily in certain spots" in Question 4 "SKIN TYPE" then they will be redirected to Question 6 "SKIN TYPE: COMBINATION".
        - **bin** - Delete the current Jump Logic rule.
        - **+ Add concurrent logic (AND)** - Adds a new AND logical statement to the same rule. AND conditional statements can be tricky, as both statements have to be true for the rule to take effect. For most quizzes, using the OR rule is enough.
            !!! example
                ![quiz builder conditional logic jump logic AND rule](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogic_exampleAND.png)
                In the example, **only if** a user chooses a choice "Oily all over" in Question 4 "SKIN TYPE" **and** a choice "Teens and 20's" in Question 3 "AGE GROUP" they will be redirected to Question 8 "SKIN TYPE: OILY".
        - **Default destination** - Select a slide or URL where the user will be always redirected after this slide.
            ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogic_defaultdestination](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogic_defaultdestination.png)
    5. **Preview and Adjust:** Publish the changes with the top-right `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz and test the setup.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N2gudKAy4qU?si=Ud8s2dtSN0uJECkC&amp;start=13" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    Jump Logic allows you to branch the quiz based on the participant's responses.
    For example, you can create a quiz that asks the participant about their skin type and then based on the answer, you can redirect them to a different question or content.
    ![how to use jump logic](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_jump_logic_default_destination.png)
    **How to set this up?**
    **Step 1: Add Questions and Follow-up Statements** Create a quiz with a main question and follow-up questions or statement. For example, a skincare quiz with a skin type question and four different texts based on user responses.
    ![how to use jump logic](https://loom.com/i/11c8cff2e27a451a8c8b40b348de4a42?workflows_screenshot=true)
    **Step 2: Add Jump Logic** Add Jump Logic to the main question. Navigate to the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab. Select the main question, in this example it's the skin type question (Question 4).
    Add Jump Logic rules for each skin type response, like the following example:
    ![how to use jump logic](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_jump_logic_rule.png){width="300"}
    - Dry and tight all over ‚Üí Dry skin type statement
    - Not too oily, not too dry ‚Üí Normal skin type
    - Oily in certain spots ‚Üí Combination skin type
    - Oily all over ‚Üí Oily skin type.
    **Step 3: Adjust Default Destinations for Each Statement** Change default destinations for each skin type text.
    ![how to use jump logic](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_jump_logic_rule2.png){width="300"}
    - Dry skin type ‚Üí Next question (skin concerns)
    - Combination skin type ‚Üí Next question (skin concerns)
    - Normal skin type ‚Üí Next question (skin concerns)
    - Oily skin type ‚Üí Next question (skin concerns).
    **Step 4: Save & Test the Logic** Save changes with the top-right `Save` button and `Preview` the quiz. Test each skin type option to ensure correct text is displayed.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N2gudKAy4qU?si=0v4iXxZKuT0ljH-c&amp;start=82" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    With Jump Logic, you can send users to different results pages based on their answers.

            IF the response to the question `Q1: What is your skin type?` is `Dry`, then go to `Results Page 1`.
            OR
            IF the response to the question `Q1: What is your skin type?` is `Oily`, then go to `Results Page 2`.
            OR
            IF the response to the question `Q1: What is your skin type?` is `Normal`, then go to `Results Page 3`.
            OR
            IF the response to the question `Q1: What is your skin type?` is `Combination`, then go to `Results Page 4`.
    6. **Save the changes**: Click the top-right `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz.

# How to Use Skip Logic

[Skip Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#skip-logic) is a tool used in quizzes or surveys to make answering questions smoother for people taking them. It works by changing the order of questions based on the answers given to previous questions. This means if someone answers a question a certain way, they might skip some questions or see different ones next. 

!!! info "Use Skip Logic to:"

    - Skip questions based on the user's answers.
    - Show different follow-up questions based on the user's answers to multiple-choice questions that allow multiple selections. For example, if you want to show different follow-up questions based on the (skin, health) concerns the user selects.


In this article, we will show you how to set up and use Skip Logic in your quiz, including specific use-cases and step-by-step instructions.

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ImHVs7AT8YY?si=iMGaCLXqTpr8yS0B" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    ![quiz builder conditional logic](/images/how_to_use_skip_logic_cond_logic_intro.png)
    In the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab you can branch your quiz. The right menu allows you to add conditional logic rules to questions in the quiz. The left preview shows a logic tree of the quiz. Any branching you add will be reflected on the tree preview.
    By default, the quiz will progress from one question to another based on the question number. Conditional logic allows you to change this default behavior.
    ??? question "How to navigate the Conditional Logic tab?"
        ![quiz builder conditional logic preview options](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_zoom.png)
        **+** - Zoom in on the logic tree preview.
        **-** - Zoom out on the logic tree preview.
        **[]** - Center the logic tree preview and fit into view.
        üîí - Toggle interactivity. Lock or unlock the interactivaity of hte preview.
        Drag the logic tree with your mouse left button to navigate to specific branches.
    1. You can introduce Skip Logic into your quiz by opening the [Quiz Builder > Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab.
    2. Select a question that you want to be skipped and in the right-hand side menu open the [Skip Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#skip-logic) dropdown.
        ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_skiplogic](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_skiplogic.png)
    3. **Add Skip Logic**: From here, click `+ Add another rule (OR)`. You can create a new Skip Logic statement specifying the conditions under which the current question should be bypassed. These statements follow a simple format: IF the answer to `question X` IS EQUAL TO `choice Y`, THEN skip this question. 
        !!! example
            ![quiz builder conditional logic skip logic rule](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_skiplogic_example.png)
            In the example, if a user chooses a choice "Too shiny" in Question 9 "SKIN CONCERNS" then Question 10 "ALERGIES" will be skipped (it will not be shown).
    4. Multiple Skip Logic rules can be added to any question if needed.
        - **+ Add another rule (OR)** - Adds another Skip Logic rule. Adds a new OR logical rule.
        - **bin** - Delete the current Skip Logic rule.
        - **+ Add concurrent logic (AND)** - Adds a new AND logical statement to the same rule. AND conditional statements can be tricky, as both statements have to be true for the rule to take effect. For most quizzes, using the OR rule is enough.
    5. **Preview and Adjust:** Publish the changes with the top-right `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz and test the setup.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ImHVs7AT8YY?si=WauBIBFSMPIlFNtm&amp;start=9" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    **Scenario**
    You want to provide personalized advice based on the customer's skin type. Imagine creating a quiz that determines a personalized skincare routine. *Question 4* might ask about the participant's skin type, and depending on the answer, a different statement or recommendation about their skincare is shown. This individualized response is made possible by Skip Logic, which then continues the quiz based on the participant's specific path.
    ![how to use skip logic example](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_skip_logic_flow.png)
    **Implementation**
    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add a `Multiple choice question` asking the customer about their skin type: Dry, Normal, Oily, or Combination-type skin. 
        !!! tip
            Use the [images or text blocks](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) to help customers determine their skin type.
    2. **Create Statement Questions**: Add multiple `Statement` slides describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:
        !!! example
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness ‚Äì we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that‚Äôs deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn‚Äôt experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin‚Äôs natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
    3. **Add Skip Logic**: If we don‚Äôt add skip logic to the quiz, our statement questions will just appear one after the other, regardless of the choice we made. 
        To add [skip logic](/how-to-guides/use-skip-logic/), you should go the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab and select the quesiton that should be skipped.  
        Next, in the right-hand menu locte the `Skip Logic` section.
        Click `+ Add another rule (OR)` to add a skip logic rule to the selected statement slide. 
        For example:
        ![how to hide content with logic shopifyv2 skip logic rule](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_skip_logic_rule.png)
        If the response for Question 4 **is not** "Dry and tight all over" then this question will be skipped. Meaning that if any other answer than "Dry and thight all over" is selected, then this question will be skipped.
        Use similar skip logic rules on the other statements to ensure that only relevant statement questions appear based on the customer's skin type selection.
    4. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz.
    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ImHVs7AT8YY?si=8mMuIlNk_TnNkKnD&amp;start=62" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    **Scenario**
    You want to create a beauty quiz where customers can select multiple areas of concern (acne, flaky skin, wrinkles, etc.) and then only see follow-up questions relevant to their selections. The goal is to display only the follow-up questions that are relevant to the user's selections. For example, if a user selects 'acne' as a skin concern, only questions related to acne should be displayed.
    **Implementation**
    1. **Setting Up Follow-Up Questions**: Use the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) to add a multiple-choice question that allows multiple selections (this can be done via the [Multiple Choice Block Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#multiple-choice)) and create several follow-up questions that match the choices in the initial question.
        !!! example
            For example, if my Skin Concerns question has the following choices:
            - Acne
            - Flaky Skin
            - Wrinkles
            I can create the following follow-up questions:
            ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_skiplogic_example](/images/how_to_shopifyV2_skiplogic_example_logic_multipleselection_questions.png)
        !!! warning
            Follow-up questions should be ordered in the same order as the choices presented in the initial question. So if the first choice is 'acne', the first follow-up question should be the one related to acne, and so on.
    2. **Configuring Skip Logic Rules**: Head over to the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab and select the question that should be skipped. For each follow-up question, establish a skip logic rule: 
        Skip Logic Rules will follow the following format:
        !!! example
            **IF** the response to the question... `Q9: Skin Concerns` **is not** `acne`, then this question will be skipped.
            ![how_to_shopifyV2_skiplogic_example_logic_rule_multipleselection](/images/how_to_shopifyV2_skiplogic_example_logic_rule_multipleselection.png)
        Similar rules must be applied for the other skin concern follow-up questions.
    3. **Testing Skip Logic Functionality**: After setting up the skip logic, make sure to save the changes with the top-right `Save` button. Then, ` Preview` the quiz and test the functionality by selecting different options in the quiz. 
        *For instance, selecting 'acne' and 'wrinkles' should display only the relevant follow-up questions while skipping others. If 'tight flaky skin' is selected, only questions related to flaky skin should appear, confirming that the skip logic is functioning correctly.*
    **Scenario**
    You want to collect emails from interested customers without deterring others.
    ![how to use skip logic example2](/images/how_to_shopifyV2_skiplogic_example_logic_email_question_skipped.png)
    **Implementation**
    - Start with a [`Yes/No question`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#yesno) asking if the customer is willing to leave their email.
    - Follow up with an [`email` input question](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#email).
    - Apply Skip Logic to the email question: if the customer opts out in the previous step, they are directed straight to the results page, bypassing the email question.

# App Settings

## General

--- Shopify Specific Content ---

![manual_shopifyV2_appsettings](/images/manual_shopifyV2_appsettings.png)
    From the Store settings menu you can:
    `Shopify Markets` - Assign quizzes to different markets and languges via the [Shopify Markets](#markets) tab.
    `Catalogue` - Run a catalog sync from the [Catalogue](#catalogue) tab or check when the last sync was completed.
    `SMTP settings` - Provide your email [SMTP scredentials](#smtp) to send result emails from your email provider.
    `Plans and pricing` - Manage you current subscription and plan details from the [Plans & Pricing](#plans-pricing) tab.
    ![manual_shopifyV2_appsettings_catalogue](/images/manual_shopifyV2_appsettings_catalogue.png)
    Our app automatically updates your store's catalog daily and after changes. This includes products, collections, tags, variants, and vendors. You can also manually pull the catalog anytime to ensure that all information is up-to-date and accurate.
    `Import Catalogue` - Start a new catlogue sync. This takes a few minutes.
    `Last catalogue import:` - The last time an item from a catalog was updated (in real time) in the app.
    `Catalogue processed at:` - The last time the product catalog was fully processed and updated.
    `Low inventory Filter` - This setting lets you control which products are eligible to be recommended in the quiz results based on stock levels.   
    If you check the `Filter products by inventory level` box, the app will hide any products that are low or out of stock from quiz recommendations. This prevents customers from seeing or clicking on products that are unavailable to purchase. If left unchecked, the app may still recommend products even if they are sold out. Once checked, the **`Minimum stock level`** option will become avilable. You can set the minimum stock level for products to be eligible for recommendations.
    `Draft products` - this setting lets you control which products are eligible to be recommended in the quiz results based on draft status.
    `Include draft products in recommendations` - When enabled, recommendations will include products or variants that are in draft status. Draft products could be recommended and will be shown in the 'Quiz preview' and under [Responses > Analysis](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#response-analysis). This setting is useful if you want to build your quiz with draft products and test it before publishing them. Draft products won't be displayed in the live quiz until they're published.
    ![app settings smtp](/images/manual_shopifyV2_appsettings_smtp.png)
    **SMTP Settings** 
    SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. SMTP is a connection protocol that enables third-party apps (e.g. RevenueHunt: Product Recommendation Quiz) to send emails through your email server.
    When you connect the RevenueHunt app to your SMTP Server, the follow-up emails with the quiz results that are sent to your customers won't be sent from our *no-reply@prq.email* email account, they'll be sent from your email account. 
    !!! tip
        Check [How to Send Result Emails from your own server](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails-from-custom-server/) for detailed instructions on how to set this up.
    `SMTP From` - Set what name and email the customer will see when they receive the email. The "From" field must be in format: `"Full Name" <name@company.com>`.
    `SMTP Server` - Set your server URL. The "Server" field must be in format: `smtp.example.com`.
    `SMTP Username` - Set your SMTP Username.
    `SMTP Password`  - Provide the password associated with the username.
    `SMTP Port` - Set the SMTP port (25, 465, 587 or 2525)
    `SMTP Authentication`  - Select from teh dropdown your SMTP email authentication method.
    `Enable STARTTLS` - Check to enable STARTTLS. *STARTTLS is a protocol command used to upgrade an existing insecure connection to a secure, encrypted connection using TLS (Transport Layer Security). It typically runs over port 587. You should check this if your mail server supports STARTTLS".* Note that this option is enabled by default, but you should untick it if your SMTP server does not support STARTTLS, as this could prevent successful connections.
    `Enable SSL` - Check to enable SLL. *SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is an older protocol for encrypting connections. If enabled, your connection starts as secure from the beginning (unlike STARTTLS which upgrades after connecting). This is usually used on port 465. Only enable SSL if your SMTP provider specifies SSL.* This option is enabled by default, but should be unticked for SMTP servers that don't use SSL encryption.
    !!! tip "Troubleshooting"
        If you see an error check your SMTP settings with the help of a third-party tool such as [Gmass](https://www.gmass.co/smtp-test) or any other SMTP test site. If your settings work as intended there, they should work on our end, too. If you're having issues, please get in touch with your developer / SMTP provider.
    At this moment in time, there is no way to activate the Shop App in the `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app. 
    ![manual_shopifyV2_appsettings_markets](/images/manual_shopifyV2_appsettings_markets.png)
    Tailor your customer experience by assigning specific quizzes to each of your store's Shopify Markets. Customize product recommendations, content, and language to meet the unique preferences of your global audience.
    Click the `dropdown list` to select a quiz that will be shown by default to the visitors of that Markets version of your store.
    ![manual_shopifyV2_appsettings_markets_pickquiz](/images/manual_shopifyV2_appsettings_markets_pickquiz.png)
    `Show All Locales` -  Click to display a list of all markets, lanugages and currencies. Once activated gives you a chance to pick a different quiz that will be shown by dafault for the customer from that Market **and** lanuguage.
    ![manual_shopifyV2_appsettings_markets_showall](/images/manual_shopifyV2_appsettings_markets_showall.png)
    `Hide All Locales` - Click to return to a simplified view of all Markets, without language disctinction. The app will show the default quiz for all the visitors from that Market regardless of the language they chose.
    `Default` - Select the default quiz for a speciifc region.
    `Language` - Selct a default quiz for a specific language in this region.
    `Currency` - Type `{{amount}} EUR` or `${{amount}}` to change the currency format as displayed on the results page.
    Check [Plans & Pricing](/reference/plans-pricing/) for more information on the different plans and pricing options available.

        How to Fix It:
        Go to **Shopify Admin ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Markets ‚Üí Preferences** and ensure that compare-at prices are enabled for the relevant market (e.g., Germany or the EEA).

    Conditional Logic controls the quiz flow, determining exactly which questions, texts, or results are shown to customers based on their answers. 
    This tutorial covers the three logic types: Jump Logic, Skip Logic, and Display Logic, with practical examples of each.
    **Objective**: In this tutorial, we‚Äôll teach you how to show custom content based on customer answers using [Jump Logic](#jump-logic), [Skip Logic](#skip-logic), or [Display Logic](#display-logic) on the results page.
    Jump Logic is used to redirect users to different questions, results pages, or external URLs, based on their responses. 
    ### Branching the Quiz
    Jump Logic allows you to branch the quiz based on the participant's responses.
    !!! example "Example: Skincare Quiz that shows only the relevant statement based on the user's skin type"
        For example, you can create a quiz that asks the participant about their skin type and then based on the answer, you can redirect them to a different question or content.
        ![how to use jump logic](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_jump_logic_default_destination.png)
    1. **Add Questions and Follow-up Statements.** Create a quiz with a main question and follow-up questions or statement. 
        !!! example
            For example, a skincare quiz with a skin type question and four different texts based on user responses.

            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn‚Äôt experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin‚Äôs natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
    2. Navigate to the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab and select the main question. 
    3. Click on the main question and open the [Jump Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) tab. Click `+ Add another rule(OR)` and set up a redirection rule.

            IF the response to the question `Pick your quesions` `is/is not` `Pick the choice`, THEN go to... `Link to URL`.
        !!! example
            IF the answer to the question `Q10: ALERGIES` is `Rose`, THEN go to... `Link to URL` and paste the desired URL, for example `https://yourstore.com/alergies`.
             ![how to send users to an external url jump logic](https://loom.com/i/87753ed6e35d45ee8f0abfb0d1c3c92b?workflows_screenshot=true)
        !!! tip "Tip: Always redirect to URL after a question"
            To always redirect users to a specific page after a certain question, you can set up a `Default destination` rule. 
            1. Click on a question and open the [Jump Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) tab. 
            2. In the `Default destination` section, select `Link to URL` and paste the desired URL, for example `https://yourstore.com/`. 
            3. This way users will be redirected to the desired page after answering the question.
    6. Click the top-right `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz. Preview the quiz with the top-right `Preview` button and test the logic.
    Skip Logic hides specific slides when they are not relevant, based on user responses.
    ### Skip Slides
    !!! example "Example: Skincare Quiz that shows only the relevant statement based on the user's skin type"
        You want to provide personalized advice based on the customer's skin type. Imagine creating a quiz that determines a personalized skincare routine. *Question 4* might ask about the participant's skin type, and depending on the answer, a different statement or recommendation about their skincare is shown. This individualized response is made possible by Skip Logic, which then continues the quiz based on the participant's specific path.
        ![how to use skip logic example](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_skip_logic_flow.png)
    1. Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add a `Multiple choice question` asking the customer about their skin type: Dry, Normal, Oily, or Combination-type skin. 
    2. Add multiple [`Statement` slides](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#statement) describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:
        !!! example "Statement Slides"
            ![skip logic skip slides statements](https://loom.com/i/11c8cff2e27a451a8c8b40b348de4a42?workflows_screenshot=true)
            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness ‚Äì we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that‚Äôs deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn‚Äôt experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin‚Äôs natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
        !!! note 
            If we don‚Äôt add skip logic to the quiz, our statement questions will just appear one after the other, regardless of the choice we made. 
    3. To add [Skip logic](/how-to-guides/use-skip-logic/), you should go the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab and select the first statement quesiton that should be skipped.  
    4. Next, in the right-hand menu locate the [`Skip Logic`](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#skip-logic) section.
    5. Click `+ Add another rule (OR)` to add a skip logic rule to the selected statement slide. 
        !!! info "Skip Logic format"
            IF the response to the question `Pick your quesions` `is/is not` `Pick the choice`, THEN this question will be skipped.
        !!! example
            IF the response to the question `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Dry and tight all over`, THEN this question will be skipped.
            Meaning that if any other answer than "Dry and tight all over" is selected, then this question will be skipped.
            ![how to hide content with logic shopifyv2 skip logic rule](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_skip_logic_rule.png)
    6. Use similar skip logic rules on the other statements to ensure that only relevant statement questions appear based on the customer's skin type selection.
        !!! example "Skip Logic for other statements"
            IF the response to the question `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Dry and tight all over`, THEN this question will be skipped.
            IF the response to the question `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Not too oily, not too dry`, THEN this question will be skipped.
            IF the response to the question `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Oily all over`, THEN this question will be skipped.
            IF the response to the question `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Oily in certain areas`, THEN this question will be skipped.
    7. Click the top-right `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz. Preview the quiz with the top-right `Preview` button and test the logic.
    ### Skip Follow-up Questions (Multiple Selection Questions)
    !!! example "Skincare Quiz that shows only follow-up questions relevant to the user's selections"
        You want to create a beauty quiz where customers can select multiple areas of concern (acne, flaky skin, wrinkles, etc.) and then only see follow-up questions relevant to their selections. The goal is to display only the follow-up questions that are relevant to the user's selections. For example, if a user selects 'acne' as a skin concern, only questions related to acne should be displayed, all the others skipped.
    1. Use the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) to add a multiple-choice question that **allows multiple selections** (this can be done via the [Multiple Choice Block Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#multiple-choice)) and create several follow-up questions that match the choices in the initial question.
        !!! example "Setting Up Follow-up Questions"
            For example, if a Skin Concerns question has the following choices:
            - Acne
            - Flaky Skin
            - Wrinkles
            The following follow-up questions can be created:
            ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_skiplogic_example](/images/how_to_shopifyV2_skiplogic_example_logic_multipleselection_questions.png)
        !!! warning
            Follow-up questions should be ordered in the same order as the choices presented in the initial question. So if the first choice is 'acne', the first follow-up question should be the one related to acne, and so on.
    2. Head over to the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab and select the first follow-up question, right after the multiple selection question. 
    3. Open the [Skip Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#skip-logic) tab.
    4. Click `+ Add another rule (OR)` to add a skip logic rule to the selected follow-up question. 
        !!! info "Skip Logic format"
            IF the response to the question `Pick your quesions` `is/is not` `Pick the choice`, THEN this question will be skipped.
        !!! example
            IF the response to the question `Q9: Skin Concerns` is `acne`, THEN this question will be skipped.
            ![how to hide content with logic shopifyv2 skip logic rule](/images/how_to_shopifyV2_skiplogic_example_logic_rule_multipleselection.png)
    5. For each  subsequent follow-up question, add a similar skip logic rule.
    6. After setting up the skip logic, make sure to save the changes with the top-right `Save` button. Then, ` Preview` the quiz and test the functionality by selecting different options in the quiz. 
        !!! example "Testing Skip Logic Functionality"
            For instance, selecting 'acne' and 'wrinkles' should display only the relevant follow-up questions while skipping others. If 'tight flaky skin' is selected, only questions related to flaky skin should appear, confirming that the skip logic is functioning correctly.
    Display Logic controls which sections appear on the results page, based on answers, variables, or scores.
    ### Add Scores or Variables to Choices
    Custom scores or variables can be assigned to choices in the quiz in order to set up a scoring quiz, personality type quiz, dosha quiz, etc.
    To add scores or variables to choices, follow these steps:
    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add your `Multiple choice questions` asking the customer about their needs. For example: age, skincondition, etc. if you are building a quzi that determines a skin type.
    2. Open the [Choice Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings).
    3. Find the `Scores and calculations` section.
    4. You can adjust the pre-made 'score' variable for each choice with the up/down arrows. You can assign negative values if needed
        ![how to add scores or variables to choices](https://loom.com/i/8180f5a1dd8c48a894ac3a6300bd7fe4?workflows_screenshot=true)
        !!! example
            - For choice one, set the score to 1.
            - For choice two, set the score to 2.
            - For choice three, set the score to 3.
    5. To create a new variable, click on the `Search or create variable` search bar and start typing the name of the variable you want to create (e.g. `dry skin` or `variable1`). 
    6. Once you've typed the full name, a dropdown will appear that will allow you to `Create a new variable "xxx"`. Click on it to add a new variable.
        ![how to add scores or variables to choices](https://loom.com/i/7b28b691b0e8451dadaaab68807ae51f?workflows_screenshot=true)
    7. Once a new variable is created, you can assign a score to it.
    8. Repeat the process for each choice in that question and move on to the next question in your quiz.
    ### Based on Customer Answers
    !!! example "Example: Show a different section on a Results Page based on the customer's answer to a question"
        You want to show a different section on a Results Page based on the customer's answer to a question. Imagine creating a quiz that determines a personalized skincare routine. *Question 4* might ask about the participant's skin type, and depending on the answer, a different text and recommendation about their skincare is shown on the Results Page. This individualized response is made possible by Display Logic.
    1. Add sections to the Results Page. Open the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) and add different sections.
        !!! example "Example: Results Page with four sections"
            The quiz has four sections on the Results Page for different skin types: Dry Skin, Normal Skin, Oily Skin, and Combination Skin. Without display logic, all sections would be visible at once.To show only one section based on user responses, display logic must be applied to each section.
    2. Click on a section title to open the Section settings. From the side menu, click `+ Add logic condition (OR)` to create a new Display Logic rule.
    3. Add a Display Logic rule for the first section.
        !!! info "Display Logic format"
            - **If** `The response to question` - Choose the `question` that determines the skin type.
            - **is** - Select the choice that corresponds to `Dry Skin`.
            - **THEN section is VISIBLE**
            - Choose `Default visibility` to be `Hidden`.
        !!! example "Example: Display Logic rule for the Dry Skinsection"
            - **If** `The response to question` - Choose the `question` that determines the skin type.
            - **is** - Select the choice that corresponds to `Dry Skin`.
            - **THEN section is VISIBLE**
            - Choose `Default visibility` to be `Hidden`.
            ![display logic example](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_answers_example1.png)
    4. Repeat the process for other skin types.
        !!! example "Example: Display Logic rule for other sections"
            - If the response to the question `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Dry and tight all over`, then the section is visible. Default visibility is set to `Hidden`.
            - If the response to the question `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Not too oily, not too dry`, then the section is visible. Default visibility is set to `Hidden`.
            - If the response to the question `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Oily all over`, then the section is visible. Default visibility is set to `Hidden`.
            - If the response to the question `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Oily in certain areas`, then the section is visible. Default visibility is set to `Hidden`.
    5. Publish the changes with the top-right `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz and test the setup. Preview the quiz by clicking `Preview` button and select different skin types to ensure only the relevant section is displayed.
        !!! tip "Advanced Display Logic Conditions"
            You can set multiple conditions for the same section in Display logic: 
            - Example 1: A section can be visible if the skin type is "dry and tight" OR if the age group is "teens".
            - Example 2: A section can be visible if both conditions are met: skin type is "dry and tight" AND skin concerns include "acne".
        !!! warning
            If your display logic depends on many different conditions, you can use the `AND` operator to combine them.
            However, using too many conditions can make the logic complex and difficult to understand. In that case, it's better to use a different approach. Consider building a quiz that is Based on a [Winning Variable](/tutorials/conditional-logic/#based-on-winning-variable) or a [Total Score](/tutorials/conditional-logic/#based-on-total-score).
    ### Based on Winning Variable
    !!! example "Example: Show a different section on a Results Page based on the winning variable"
        You're building a personality-type or Dosha quiz. You want to show a different text and product recommendations based on the winning variable. For examples, if the user chooses mostly A's, B's, C's, etc. a different section with different text and product recommendations is shown.
    1. Open the [Questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) tab and add Questions and Choices. 
        !!! example "Example: Quiz with five questions, each with five choices"
            The quiz consists of five questions, each with five choices.  Each question and choice should help the user determine their skin type.
    2. Assign varaibles to choices. Each choice is associated with a [custom variable and a score](#how-to-add-scores-or-variables-to-choices) via the [`Choices Settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings) section. 
        !!! tip
            To learn how to add scores or variables to choices, check out [this section](#add-scores-or-variables-to-choices).
        !!! example "Example: Assigning variables to choices"
            Each answer contributes a score of +1 to the corresponding skin type variable: 
            - Dry skin: `dry +1`    
            - Normal skin: `normal +1`
            - Oily skin: `oily +1`
            - Combination skin: `combination +1`
            - Sensitive skin: `sensitive +1`
            ![how to shopifyv2 use display logic based on variable example1 scores](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_variable_example1_scores.png)
            This scoring will help determine the user's skin type based on their responses.
    3. Go to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) tab and add different sections to the Results Page. 
        !!! example "Example: Results Page with five sections"
            The results page contains five sections, each corresponding to a skin type. Each section contains a heading, text and a product block to recommend products for that skin type.
    4. Make sure each section contains a [product block](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections) to recommend products for that skin type.
        !!! info "Product recommendations"
            Each section can display recommended products in a [product block](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections) based on user responses or fixed recommendations: 
            - **Dynamic Recommendations:** Requires upvoting products via choice settings to influence the recommendation algorithm.
            - **Fixed Recommendations:** Set specific products to always display for each skin type section by changing the recommendation system to fixed and selecting items for each block. Ensure to configure fixed recommendations for all sections to provide consistent product suggestions.
            Change the `Recommendation System` in the [`Product Block Settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections) to whatever best suits your needs. For a personality-type quiz, we recommend using `Fixed Recommendations` and selecting products for each section.
    5. To display the correct section based on the highest scoring variable, go to Section Settings, find `Display Logic` and click `+ Add condition (OR)`.
    6. Add Display Logic to the Section. Set up the rule like this:
        !!! info "Display Logic format"
            - **If** `The variable with the highest score` 
            - `is/is not` - `Pick the variable` 
            - **THEN this section is VISIBLE**
            - `Default visibility` is `Visible/Hidden`.
        !!! example "Example: Display Logic rule for the Dry Skin section"
            - **If** `The variable with the highest score` 
            - `is` - `dry` 
            - **THEN this section is VISIBLE**
            - Set the `Default visibility` to `Hidden`.
            ![how to shopifyv2 use display logic based on variable example1 display logic](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_variable_example1.png)
    7. For each section, set a similar rule for the visibility condition.
        !!! example "Example: Display Logic rule for other skin type sections"
            - If the highest score is `dry`, show the dry skin section.
            - If the highest score is `normal`, show the normal skin section.
            - If the highest score is `oily`, show the oily skin section.
            - If the highest score is `combination`, show the combination section.
            - If the highest score is `sensitive`, show the sensitive skin section.
    8. Publish the changes with the top-right `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz and click `Preview` to test the setup. 
        !!! tip "Testing the setup"
            Select answers that correspond to a specific skin type (e.g., mostly dry skin). Verify that the correct results section is displayed based on the selected answers.
    ### Based on Total Score
    !!! example "Example: Show a different section on a Results Page based on the total score"
        You're building a custom scoring or presonality-type quiz. You want to show a different text and product recommendations based on the score of a variable. For examples, if the user's score is above 50, a different section with different text and product recommendations is shown.
    1. Open the [Questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) tab and add Questions and Choices. 
        !!! example "Example: Quiz with five questions, each with five choices"
            The quiz consists of five questions, each with five choices.  Each question and choice should help the user determine their skin type.
    2. Assign varaibles to choices. Each choice is associated with a [custom variable and a score](#how-to-add-scores-or-variables-to-choices) via the [`Choices Settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings) section. 
        !!! tip
            To learn how to add scores or variables to choices, check out [this section](#add-scores-or-variables-to-choices).
        !!! example "Example: Assigning scoresto choices"
            Each answer contributes a score of +1 to the corresponding skin type variable: 
            - First choice: `+1 point`
            - Second choice: `+2 points`
            - Third choice: `+3 points`
            - Fourth choice: `+4 points`
            - Fifth choice: `+5 points`
            The total score helps determine the user's skin type based on their selections.
            ![how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_score_example1](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_score_example1.png)
    3. Go to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) tab and add different sections to the Results Page. 
        !!! example "Example: Results Page with five sections"
            The results page contains five sections, each corresponding to a skin type. Each section contains a heading, text and a product block to recommend products for that skin type.
    4. Make sure each section contains a [product block](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections) to recommend products for that skin type.
        !!! info "Product recommendations"
            Each section can display recommended products in a [product block](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections) based on user responses or fixed recommendations: 
            - **Dynamic Recommendations:** Requires upvoting products via choice settings to influence the recommendation algorithm.
            - **Fixed Recommendations:** Set specific products to always display for each skin type section by changing the recommendation system to fixed and selecting items for each block. Ensure to configure fixed recommendations for all sections to provide consistent product suggestions.
            Change the `Recommendation System` in the [`Product Block Settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections) to whatever best suits your needs. For a personality-type quiz, we recommend using `Fixed Recommendations` and selecting products for each section.     
    5. Come up with score ranges that should determine the visibility of the sections.
        !!! example "Example: Score ranges"
            - Dry skin should be shown if the score is between 5 and 7 (inclusive): `score >= 5 && score <= 7`
            - Normal skin should be shown if the score is between 8 and 12 (inclusive): `score >= 8 && score <= 12`
            - Oily skin should be shown if the score is between 13 and 17 (inclusive): `score >= 13 && score <= 17`
            - Combination skin should be shown if the score is between 18 and 22 (inclusive): `score >= 18 && score <= 22`
            - Sensitive skin should be shown if the score is between 23 and 25 (inclusive): `score >= 23 && score <= 25`
    6. To display the correct section based on the total score, go to Section Settings, find `Display Logic` and click `+ Add condition (OR)`.
    7. Add Display Logic to the Section. Set up the rule like this:
        !!! info "Display Logic format"
            - **If** `The score of a variable`  select the varaible `Selected variable` 
            - `is greater than or equal to` - `Number`- `Add your number`
            - **AND**
            - **IF** `The score of a variable`  select the varaible `Selected variable` 
            - `is less than or equal to` - `Number`- `Add your number`
            - **THEN this section is VISIBLE**
            - Set the `Default visibility` to `Hidden`.
        !!! example "Example: Display Logic rule for the Dry Skin section"
            - **If** `The score of a variable`  select the varaible `score` 
            - `is greater than or equal to` - `5`
            - **AND**
            - **IF** `The score of a variable`  select the varaible `score` 
            - `is less than or equal to` - `7`
            - **THEN this section is VISIBLE**
            - Set the `Default visibility` to `Hidden`.
            ![how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_score_example1_logic](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_score_example1_logic.png)
            This rule will show the section only if the total score is between 5 and 7 (inclusive).
    8. For each section, set a similar rule for the visibility condition.
        !!! example "Example: Display Logic rule for different skin type sections"
            - Show  dry skin section if score is between 5 and 7 (inclusive). Condition: `score >= 5 && score <= 7`
            - Show normal skin section if score is between 8 and 12 (inclusive). Condition: `score >= 8 && score <= 12`
            - Show oily skin section if score is between 13 and 17 (inclusive). Condition: `score >= 13 && score <= 17`
            - Show combination skin section if score is between 18 and 22 (inclusive). Condition: `score >= 18 && score <= 22`
            - Show sensitive skin section if score is between 23 and 25 (inclusive). Condition: `score >= 23 && score <= 25`
    9. Publish the changes with the top-right `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz and click `Preview` to test the setup. 
        !!! tip "Testing the setup"
            Select answers that correspond to a specific skin type (e.g., mostly dry skin). Verify that the correct results section is displayed based on the selected answers.

    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ccqOIhfskw?si=8px5Gl4sDuavHuDe" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
    In this tutorial, you'll learn how to connect your quiz to [Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/) and set up a post-quiz email flow.
    Connecting the quiz to Klaviyo can significantly increase your sales. 
    RevenueHunt allows you to send all quiz information directly to Klaviyo. This includes the quiz taker's email and name but also all the quiz questions, answers and recommended products.
    Let's get started.
    To send contacts to Klaviyo your quiz needs to have an [`email question`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#email). 
    1. You can add it to the quiz from the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) tab by clicking on the `+ Add Question` button and selecting the email question type or by clciking `+ Add Block` to add a new email block to an existing slide.
    2. You can [ask for marketing consent](/how-to-guides/ask-for-marketing-consent/) directly in the quiz. 
        !!! example "Example"
            - You can add a marketing [consent checkbox](/how-to-guides/ask-for-marketing-consent#option-2-marketing-checkmark) in the email question settings (as a single choice multiple-choice question).
    To connect the quiz to Klaviyo you'll have to provide your Klaviyo **Public API Key**. 
    Public API Key is essential because it allows us to send information to Klaviyo Profiles.
    1. To find your Public API Key login to your Klaviyo account.
    2. In account `Settings` open the `API Keys` tab and copy the public API Key.
    3. Navigate back to the RevenueHunt app. 
    4. Open [Quiz Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/).
    5. Find the [`Integrations`](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) section and look for Klaviyo.
    6. Paste your `Public API Key` in the appropriate field.
    7. Save your quiz changes with the top-right `Save` button.
    8. Go back to the quiz and click `Preview` to test the quiz all the way to the results. Make sure to provide a sample email that doesn't already exist in your Kalviyo account.
    9. To verify the test, open `Kalviyo > Audience > Profiles` section and search for the email address you used in the quiz.
    10. If a new profile was added the integration was successful.
        !!! tip
            If a new profile wasn't added to Profiles in Klaviyo, double-check your Public API Key and repeat the process.
    From now on all the contacts coming from the quiz will be added to your Klaviyo account.
    All quiz contacts can be grouped into a **segment** in Klaviyo. 
    1. To create a new segment in Klaviyo go to  `Audience > List & Segements` and click `Create New > New Segment`.
    2. Name the segment and set up the definition. 
    3. Segment definition: Select `Properties about someone` and add a property that will be unique for profiles coming from the quiz. This can be any of the [custom properties](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/#use-quiz-data-in-klaviyo-email-templates) that RevenueHunt sends to Klaviyo Profiles.
        !!! example "Example"
            - `ANSWERS_BY_BLOCK-QuizID` property is unique for profiles coming from the quiz.  
            - If you don't see the `ANSWERS_BY_BLOCK-QuizID` property in the dropdown menu, you may need to take a test quiz and try again.
    4. Segment definition: As segment definition set up a rule that follows this format: `Custom property from the Quiz` `is set` Type: `text`.
        !!! example "Example"
            - `ANSWERS_BY_BLOCK-QuizID` `is set` Type: `text`.
    5. Click `Create a segment` and wait for Klaviyo to load all the contacts that match the segment definition. This may take a few minutes.
    6. Once the agent finishes loading, all the profiles that already match the segment definition will be added to the segment. New contacts coming from the quiz will be added to the segment automatically.
    1. To create an email flow that includes only quiz takers open the `Flows` tab in Klaviyo. 
    2. Click `Create flow` and then `Build from scratch`.
    3. Name the flow and click `Create flow`.
    4. Next, you'll be asked to set up a flow trigger.
    5. Choose the trigger to be `Added to a segment` and select the segment created in the [previous step](/tutorials/follow-up-emails-klaviyo/#create-segment-for-quiz-takers). Click `Confirm` and `Confirm and save`. This way whenever someone enters the segment they will trigger the email flow.    
    If you've [asked for marketing consent in the quiz](/how-to-guides/ask-for-marketing-consent/), you can update it in the Klaviyo email flow. Just follw these steps:
    1. Right below the flow trigger, add a `Profile property update` action.
    2. Click `+ Step`.
    3. A menu will appear letting up set up the profile property update.
    4. Select to `Update existing property`, from the Select property dropdown menu select `Accepts marketing` and set the value to `true`.
    5. Turn this action `LIVE`.
    1. Grab the `Email` action and drop it below the last step.
    2. In `Email details` section edit the Subject.
    3. Then, click `Select template`. You'll be taken to the Templates section in Klaviyo.
    4. To create a new email template, click `Create`. You'll be redirected to the Klaviyo email builder.
    5. In the Klaviyo email builder you can use pre-designed blocs to add images or text to your template. 
    6. To add the quiz content and quiz recommended products you'll need to add an `HTML` block. Drag and drop the `HTML` block to the email builder.
    7. In the `Quiz Settings > Integrations` section, you'll find a button to download a `Klaviyo Template`. Click the `Klaviyo Template` button and a new window will open. There, click `Copy code` to copy the existing template.
        !!! info "Klaviyo Template"
            The code contains several ready-to-use code snippets that allow you to display: 
            - Quiz question answers (section `{# REFERENCE: INFORMATION GATHERED FROM THE QUESTIONS #}`)
            - Recommended products (section `{# REFERENCE: INDIVIDUAL ITEM RECOMMENDATIONS BY SLOT #}`)
            - A Static Results Page content that contains all the elements of your results page and adds content upon each quiz retake (section `{# REFERENCE: INDIVIDUAL ITEM RECOMMENDATIONS BY SLOT #}`)
            - A Dynamic Results Page content that contains all the elements of your results page and replaces content upon each quiz retake (section `{# RECOMMENDED: DYNAMIC RESULT PAGE CONTENT (LOOPS THROUGH RESULT_SECTIONS-jGzry2) #}`) **üëà this section is the recommended one to use**
    8. Paste the code in the `HTML` block in Klaviyo email.
    9. Next, `Preview` the email as one of your segment subscribers to check what information is displayed.
    10. You can freely edit the email template to your liking. For example, you can remove all the sections of the code that you don't need. You can also style the provided email code. Keep in mind, that you may need help from a developer to edit the tempalte code. Alternatively, you can try asking [Quiz Copilot](/how-to-guides/use-quiz-copilot/) or another AI agent like ChatGPT or Claude for help in styling the email.
        !!! tip
            Check the [Use quiz data in Klaviyo email templates](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/#use-quiz-data-in-klaviyo-email-templates) article to learn how to customize your Klaviyo email template with quiz properties.
    11. Once you're happy with the email template, click `Exit` then `Done` and return to your flow.
    12. Turn your email `LIVE`.
    From that moment on, all the quiz takers, who leave their email, will be automatically added to your Kalviyo Segment and will be sent a follow-up email. 
    If you want to send an email with each quiz retake, you can do that by adding a `Profile property update` action at the end of the flow. Follow these steps:
    1. Add a `Profile property update` action at the end of the flow.
    2. Click `+ Step`.
    3. Select `Delete existing property`.
    4. From the `Select property` dropdown menu select the property that was used to create a segment in earlier steps. 
        !!! example "Example"
            Select `Delete existing property` > `ANSWERS_BY_BLOCK-QuizID`. 
    5. Save the changes and turn the action `LIVE`.
    This way, each time a quiz taker takes the quiz again, they will be re-added to the segment and will trigger the email flow again.
    RevenueHunt app allows you to add contacts from the quiz directly to a **list** in Klaviyo. To do that you'll need to provide a **Private API Key**.
    1. First, make sure that you have a Klaviyo list ready to add contacts to. If you don't have one, you can create a new one in `Klaviyo > Lists & segmenets` section. In the list settings, make sure to set it to `Single Opt-in`.
    2. To create a new Private Key for the RevenueHunt app in your Klaviyo account.
    3. In account `Settings` open the `API Keys` tab and click `Create Private API Key`.
    4. Give it a name and allow `Full access`. Click `Create`. The agent will generate a new private key.
    5. Copy the generated private key.
    5. Go back to the RevenueHunt app and open the [Quiz Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/).
    6. In the `Integrations` section find `Klaviyo` and paste the `Private API Key` in the correct field.
    7. Click `Save` to confirm the changes.
    8. Go to the Quiz Builder Questions section and find the email block.
    9. In the email block settings, find the `Klaviyo list` section.
    10. From the dropdown menu select the list you want to add contacts to.
    11. Save the changes with the top-right `Save` button.
    12. Remember to `Preview` the quiz to test the connection with a sample email.

    5. To change [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings), click on the question card and use the settings panel on the right. Here, you can change things like adding a question description or an image.
    6. To make the quiz more personal you can add a `Name question` and recall the answer in other parts of the quiz using [content dynamic source](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/).
    7. To select the best cleanser, you may want to know the client's age, skin type and the environment they live in. `Multiple-choice questions` may be the best way to find out this information. Let's ask about a skin type. 
    8. Finally, we should find out the environment they live in. To make the quiz more interesting, we'll use a `Picture question` here. 
    9. Don't forget to add an `email question`! That's how you'll collect valuable leads for your marketing campaigns. In the question settings you can make this one optional.
    10. Once you have all your questions you can move them around by drag and drop. 
    11. Make sure to keep the quiz short. Customers typically drop out after question 8 and almost nobody gets to question 12. There's power in simplicity!
    1. You can change the look of your quiz in the [Quiz Design](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/) tab.
    2. In the [Color Scheme Section](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/#my-themes), you'll see some premade themes that you can choose from.
    3. Or you can create your own design by clicking on different elements in the editing panel.
    4. To make the quiz match the store's style let's:
        - edit the font, 
        - change the background color, 
        - remove or add a background image, 
        - and change the color of the buttons and choices. 
    5. You can even [add custom CSS code](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/#add-custom-css-code) to make the quiz unique.
    6. All the changes you make will be saved automatically.
    1. Our dashboard will remind you if there are no products associated with the answers.
    2. To add a product, open the [choice settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings) and click on the [Upvote](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) section.
    3. Your store's products will appear as a list. Scroll down to select items or just start typing the name.
    4. Multiple products can be assigned to the same answer.
    5. Product Recommendation Quiz works like a [voting system](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/). 
        - Products are linked to each choice. 
        - When a customer picks that choice, all linked products receive one vote.
        - After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the products sorted by the number of votes.
        - If there is a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the products.
    6. Make sure to link products to each question and choice in the quiz. 
    7. You can test different answering routes and results by clicking on the `Save` button to update your changes and then `Preview`.
    1. Just like in the Quiz Builder, you can add multiple sections to your [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) by clicking on the `Results Page` tab. 
    2. Click on the `+ Add Block` button to select a block type. 
        - In `text blocks`, you can write insightful information about the product recommended.
        - With an `image block`, you can add your brand's logo.
        - In the `button block`, you can add a button to a custom URL.
        - In the `Products block`, you can select how many products will be recommended. 
    1. Once your quiz is set up, go to your [Dashboard](/reference/dashboard/) make the quiz your default by clicking on the `Make default` button.
    2. Navigate to the [`Publish`](/reference/quiz-builder/share-publish/) section to see all the publishing options.
    3. For example, you can [embed a link to the quiz in your website's menu](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-link#link-popup-in-website-menu).
    4. In Shopify, go to the `Online Store > Themes` section and click on `Customize`. 
    5. Under `App Embeds` find `V2 - Link Popup Quiz` and activate it. 
    6. In the settings you can adjust the quizzes width and height. Then, click on `Save`.
    7. Next, in Shopify navigate to `Content > Menus`, select the main menu and click `+ Add menu item`. In the `Title` field, enter something like `Take our Quiz`. Under `link` section, type `#quiz`, click on the link to accept it.
    8. Save the menu and you're done!
    10. You can now test the quiz on the live site by clicking the link in the menu.

    </div>
    Design customization in RevenueHunt works at several levels:
    - The [Quiz Design](#quiz-design-tab) tab gives you global control over fonts, colors, and navigation.
    - The [Questions](#questions-tab) tab lets you style each slide individually.

    - And when you need full control, **custom CSS** and **JavaScript** are available at every step.
    The **Quiz Design** tab is your main hub for styling the quiz. Here you can change fonts, colors, backgrounds, navigation, and slide transitions.
    - Access the [Quiz Design](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/) tab by clicking `Customize` on your quiz.
    - Choose from pre-designed **color schemes** or customize your own.

        ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_quizdesign_advanced](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_quizdesign_advanced.png){width="300"}
    !!! tip "Tips for using CSS in the quiz:"
        - For examples, check the [App CSS Structure](/reference/css-structure/) reference in our docs.
        - For specific elements, use the browser's inspect tool to identify selectors for CSS rules.
        - Click `‚ú®Get help with custom CSS` to open a chat window with the Quiz Copilot AI. It can directly make design changes with CSS code!
        - Custom CSS and JavaScript options are available at *every level of customization (whole quiz, questions,, results page)*, allowing for detailed control over quiz appearance and behavior.
    The **Questions** tab lets you design each slide. You can add blocks such as text, images, videos, or choice elements, then rearrange them for a unique layout.
    - Design individual slides in the [Questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) tab by adding blocks (text, images, videos, answer choices).
        ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_questions_blocktypes](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_questions_blocktypes.png){width="300"}

    ### Block Settings
    - Open [block settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) by clicking on the block.
    - Customize each block within a question: 
    - **Text blocks**: format text, add links, recall previous answers.
        ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_questions_blocksettings_heading](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_questions_blocksettings_heading.png){width="300"}
    - **Image blocks**: resize and align graphics.
    - **Picture-choice blocks**: select image ratios and mobile layout options (1-2 per row or carousel).
    ### Choice Settings
    [**Choice settings**](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings) give you control over individual answers, letting you tweak each option separately.
    The Results Page tab is where you design what users see after completing the quiz.
    You can add text, images, videos, product blocks, buttons, or even custom HTML. Each section and block has its own settings, similar to the Questions tab, allowing you to style and align content exactly how you want it.
    ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_blocktypes](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_blocktypes.png)
    - Each block has design settings for styling and layout adjustments.
    In the [Results Page settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#results-page-settings), you can apply a dedicated background image, or inject CSS and JavaScript that only affect this page.
    ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_resultspagesettings](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_resultspagesettings.png){width="300"}
    The most important part of this tab is the [Product Block](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections). 
    ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_blocksettings_products](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_resultspage_resultspages_blocksettings_products.png){width="300"}
    Here, you decide how recommended products appear. You can:
    - Choose alignment and text sizes.
    - Reorder product components (image, title, price, vendor, metafields, etc.) by dragging and dropping.
    - Add or remove components to build your perfect product card.
    - Configure individual component settings, such as image quality for product photos or which metafields to display.

        - 'Skincare Quiz (French)'.
    1. Open the RevenueHunt Quizzes app.

    To create quizzes in other languages:
    5. Duplicate the quiz and manually translate questions and choices to another language. 
        !!! tip "Use Quiz Copilot"
            You can ask [Quiz Copilot](/how-to-guides/use-quiz-copilot/) to create a translated copy.

            RevenueHunt app does not offer an in-app automatic translation option but you can ask [Quiz Copilot](/how-to-guides/use-quiz-copilot/) to create a translated copy.
    6. In [`Quiz settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/) go to [`Quiz content`](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#messages-quiz-contentt) click `Reset messages` and change the language of system buttons and helpers as needed.

            - assign 'Skincare Quiz USA' to the United States market.
            ![sample market assignment](https://loom.com/i/952e7d4c5972482496d85350ca8cb927?workflows_screenshot=true)

    By default, quiz result prices follow the currency format in your Shopify Markets settings.
    !!! example 
        If `USD` is your default currency format for US market, prices on the results page of the quiz will be displayed as `25 USD`.
    To change the format for a specific market:
    1. Find the [`Shopify Markets`](/reference/app-settings/#shopify-markets) tab and open it. You'll see a list of all your markets.
    2. Click `Show all locales` and every market listing will expand with extra dropdown field for languages available in your Shopify store and a `Currency` field.
    3. In the `Currency` field, enter your preferred format.
        !!! example 
            - `${{amount}}` > This will display prices as $25.00 instead of 25 USD.
            - `‚Ç¨{{amount}}` > This will display prices as ‚Ç¨25.00 instead of 25 EUR.
            ![sample currency format](https://loom.com/i/251334029cab4f409b2c6fc94a9d186a?workflows_screenshot=true)
    4. Save the changes with the `Save` button.
    Before testing, you need to ensure that your default quiz is published on the website. Otherwise, the RevenueHunt app will not be able to display any quizzes.
    To publish the default quiz:
    1. Go to the [`Publish`](/reference/quiz-builder/publish/) tab in the RevenueHunt app.
    2. Pick a publishing option and follow the instructions to add the quiz to your website.
    3. Once the default quiz is published, the Revenue Hunt app will automatically detect the customer's market and language to display the correct quiz.
    Once the default quiz is published and markets set up, you can preview your store and test the setup on different markets and languages.
    1. In Shopify, go to `Online store` and click the `üëÅÔ∏è` eye icon to preview the store. Your store will open in a new window. 
    2. Click on a link that opens the quiz or navigate to the page where the quiz is published. 
    3. Test by switching markets and languages to verify the correct quizzes load (e.g., US quiz for the United States, EU quiz for Belgium).
    4. Confirm that the correct quiz loads for each market and language.
    5. Check that prices are displayed in the correct format.
        !!! example "Example Test Scenarios"
            Market change: Switch to the United States ‚Üí US quiz appears.
            Market change: Switch to Belgium ‚Üí EU quiz appears.
            Language change: Change to French ‚Üí French quiz appears.
            Language change: Change to Spanish ‚Üí Spanish quiz appears.
            ![sample test](https://loom.com/i/6893314457ef4219a293e28708f91ba1?workflows_screenshot=true)
    Congratulations! You've successfully set up quizzes for different markets and languages in the RevenueHunt app.

    If you run a cosmetics shop you may want to recommend a full routine to your customers instead of singular products. With the RevenueHunt app, it is possible to group products into slots and recommend a product for each step in your beauty routine.
    !!! tip
        Check out our [Skincare Quiz Demo](https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/) site and take the quiz to see an example.
    **Objective**: In this tutorial, you‚Äôll learn how to build a quiz that recommends a four-step skincare routine to your customers.
    - The quiz recommends a tailored skincare routine including a cleanser, toner, serum, and moisturizer.
    - Recommendations are based on two key factors: age group and skin type.
    - The logic is derived from a product matrix that categorizes products accordingly.
    !!! example "Skincare Product Matrix"
        | Age/Skin Type | Dry or Normal | Oily | Combination |
        |-----------|---------------|------|-------------|
        | **Teens** | Foaming Cream Cleanser; Aloe Soothing Toner; Vitamin C Serum; Moisturizing Cream-Gel | Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Face Wash; Balancing Force Oil Control Toner; Super Antioxidant Serum; Oil-Free Moisture-Combination Skin | All Natural Face Cleanser; United State Balancing Tonic; The Ordinary "Buffet" + Copper Peptides 1%; Oil-Free Moisture Lotion |
        | **30‚Äì50** | Morning Cleanser; Aloe Soothing Toner; The Ordinary "Buffet" + Copper Peptides 1%; Relaxing Night Cream | Redness-Relief Cleansing Lotion; Balancing Force Oil Control Toner; Vitamin C Serum; Oil-Free Moisture Lotion | Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Face Wash; United State Balancing Tonic; Super Antioxidant Serum; Oil-Free Moisture-Combination Skin |
        | **50+** | Foaming Cream Cleanser; Ultra Facial Toner; Khadi Global Natural Hyaluronic Acid Serum; Relaxing Night Cream | Redness-Relief Cleansing Lotion; United State Balancing Tonic; The Ordinary "Buffet" + Copper Peptides 1%; Oil-Free Moisture Lotion | Morning Cleanser; Balancing Force Oil Control Toner; Super Antioxidant Serum; Moisturizing Cream-Gel |
    1. For the quiz to work as a funnel and filter products based on the age and skin type, you need to create collections for each age group and skin type and product type.
    2. **Create Manual Collections for Age Groups:** Go to `Shopify > Products > Collections > Add collection`. Create a `Manual` collection for each age group that includes only the products that are relevant to that age group for all skin types.
        ??? example "--Teens-- Collection should include the following products:"
            | Age Group       | Dry or Normal                                                                                   | Oily                                                                                           | Combination                                                                                   |

    Once you‚Äôve made changes to your products and collections in Shopify, the RevenueHunt app will automatically detect the changes and sync them with the app.
    !!! tip
        If you don't see the new items in the app catalog, you can run quick catalog import from the [App Settings > Catalogue](/reference/app-settings/#catalogue) page.
    Now you can build your quiz. 
    1. You can start from scratch or use one of our [pre-designed Skincare templates](/reference/dashboard/#new-quiz).
        !!! tip
            Check out our [previous step-by-step tutorial](/tutorials/making-first-quiz/) to learn how to use the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/).
    2. Start building the quiz by [adding simple questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-types) relevant to the customer.
        - Use a [`Multiple-choice question`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#multiple-choice) to find out the client‚Äôs **age** and **skin type**.
        - Use a [`Name question`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#name) to make the quiz personal.
        - Finish the quiz with an [`Email question`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#email). Quiz responses can be sent to your mailing list or CRM for segmented retargeting.
    1. In the [Quiz Design](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/) tab, you can change the look and feel of the quiz.
    2. You can even [add custom CSS code](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/#add-custom-css-code) to make it pop.
    Once your quiz is built and styled, you should add products or collections to individual choices.
    !!! warning
        It's recommended to either link products **or** a collection to each choice. Don't mix them. 
        If a product is upvoted in a choice but it is also in a collection that is linked to that choice, it **will receive 2 votes from the same choice**, which can skew the results. 
        For that reason, we recommend either linking individual products to a choice or a dedicated **single** collection to a choice.
    1. To do that, go to the [Questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) tab and select a choice. This will open the Choice settings.
    2. Under [Choice settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings), find the `Upvoting` section and click `Upvote > Collections`.
    3. For the age question, you can link the `Teens`, `30-50` and `50+` collections created earlier to each respective choice.
    4. Then, link the `Skin type` collections to the choices in the Skin type question. For example, link the `Dry or Normal` collection to the `Dry` and `Normal` choices. Link the `Combination` collection to the `Combination` choice. Link the `Oily` collection to the `Oily` choice.
    !!! info "Product recommendation algorithm"
        The product recommendation algorithm works like a [voting system](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/). 
        - Products/Collections of products are linked to each choice.
        - When a customer picks that choice all the linked products receive one vote.
        - This includes all the products inside the linked collection. 
        - At the end, the results page will show slots with products sorted by the number of votes.
    No need to exclude products. The product matrix will recommend the correct products based on the customer's answers.
    It‚Äôs time to edit the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/). 
    1. Add a heading, a logo or a text block to customize the page. For example, you can add a text block to include more information about the recommended skincare routine.
        !!! tip
            Check the [previous tutorial](/tutorials/making-first-quiz/) to see examples of different blocks being used.
    2. **Add Product Block**: Include a `Product Block` to display the recommended routine. In `Slot settings` set the `Max. recommended items` to four.
    3. **Preview the quiz**: Update the preview/with the top-right `Save` button and click `Preview` to test the quiz. Take the quiz a few times to check if the recommended products are displayed in accordance with the product matrix.
    Now let‚Äôs sort the recommended products into clear steps/categories. As a skincare store, you‚Äôd like to recommend a routine composed of a cleanser, a toner, a serum, and a moisturizer.
    1. Use `+ Add slot` to add extra slots to your Product Block on the Results page. You'll need 4 slots in total.    
    2. In [Slot settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) you can:
        - Edit the slot name, 
        - Add a description,
        - And select how many products should be recommended in each slot. Set the `Max. recommended items` to 1 for each slot.
    3. Slots won‚Äôt work as expected unless you `Add segments` to each of them. It‚Äôs how they know which products to choose. 
        Open the [Slot settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings), scroll down to the `Add segments` section and click `Add > Collection`.
        - Add the `Cleansers Quiz` smart collection in the Cleansers Slot
        - Add the `Toners Quiz` smart collection in the Toners Slot
        - Add the `Serums Quiz` smart collection in the Serum Slot,
        - Add the `Moisturizers Quiz` smart collection in the Moisturizer Slot.
    4. Save the changes with the top-right `Save` button.
    1. Update the preview with the top-right `Save` button.
    2. You can test the quiz again by clicking the `Preview` button.
    3. Take the quiz a few times to check if the correct products are recommended based on the product matrix.
    Now you‚Äôre ready to publish the quiz on your website. Let‚Äôs add it [inline with a new page](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-inline/#embedding-an-inline-quiz-on-a-new-page). 
    1. Go to the [`Publish`](/reference/quiz-builder/share-publish/) section and check the instructions for `Add the quiz to a dedicated landing page`.
    2. **Create a new page template**: 
        - In Shopify go to `Online Store > Theme > Customize`. 
        - Under Home page top menu select `Pages > Add new page template`. Give the template a name. 
        - In the page template editor, add a section. From `Apps` menu select the `Inline Quiz` by RevenueHunt. 
        - In the Inline Quiz settings, select the quiz formatting (for example, you can make the quiz full width).

    This documentation outlines the steps to create a skin type quiz that recommends products based on user responses. It covers quiz setup, variable assignment, results configuration, and integration into a Shopify store.
    ## Plan the Quiz
    Before you begin building your quiz, it‚Äôs important to plan what you want to show at the end.
    For each skin type ‚Äî dry, oily, combination, normal, or sensitive ‚Äî write a short description and decide which products you want to recommend.
    These will be set up on the results page later, so it‚Äôs good to have everything ready in advance.
    ??? example "Sample Skin Types & Recommendations Matrix:"
        | Skin Type          | Heading                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Recommended Products |
        |--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
        | üåµ Dry Skin         | You have Dry Skin       | Your skin tends to feel tight, rough, or flaky ‚Äî especially after washing. It may need extra TLC in the form of rich moisturizers and gentle, hydrating cleansers. Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and ceramides to help restore moisture and improve texture.<br><br>**Tip:** Avoid over-exfoliating and opt for creamy, non-stripping products. | 1. Relaxing Night Cream<br>2. Ultra Facial Deep Moisture Balm<br>3. Vitamin C Serum |
        | üåº Normal Skin      | You have Normal Skin    | Lucky you! Your skin feels balanced, neither too oily nor too dry. You may have occasional concerns, but overall, your skin is low-maintenance. Focus on maintaining that balance with a simple, consistent skincare routine.<br><br>**Tip:** Keep it steady with gentle cleansers, light hydration, and sunscreen. | 1. Morning Cleanser<br>2. Fresh Rose Deep Hydration Toner<br>3. Organix Facial Moisturizer |
        | üíß Oily Skin        | You have Oily Skin      | Your skin produces more oil than average, especially in the T-zone. Shine and breakouts might be common, but the upside is slower visible aging! Stick with lightweight, non-comedogenic products that help balance oil without stripping your skin.<br><br>**Tip:** Use gel-based moisturizers, salicylic acid, and clay masks to manage oil and minimize pores. | 1. Balancing Force Oil Control Toner<br>2. Oil-Free Moisture-Combination Skin<br>3. Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Face Wash |
        | üåó Combination Skin | You have Combination Skin | Your skin is a mix ‚Äî oily in some spots (like the T-zone) and dry or normal in others. You‚Äôll benefit from targeting different areas with different products or using lightweight, balanced formulas.<br><br>**Tip:** Try multi-masking or spot-treating for a tailored approach to your skin‚Äôs varying needs. | 1. Oil-Free Moisture-Combination Skin<br>2. Super Antioxidant Serum<br>3. United State Balancing Tonic |
        | üå∏ Sensitive Skin   | You have Sensitive Skin | Your skin reacts easily ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs to weather changes, new products, or stress. Redness, itching, or stinging might be common for you. A minimalist routine with soothing ingredients is your best friend.<br><br>**Tip:** Choose fragrance-free, hypoallergenic products with calming ingredients like aloe vera, chamomile, or calendula. | 1. Redness-Relief Refreshing Cleansing Lotion<br>2. Aloe Soothing Toner<br>3. Soothing Serum |
    ## Build the Quiz
    Next, let‚Äôs build the quiz. 
    1. Head over to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) > [Questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/).
    2. Add [multiple-choice questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#multiple-choice) with 5 choices each. These should help determine the customer‚Äôs skin condition. Each question and choice should give clues about the user's skin type.
        !!! tip
            Check out our previous tutorial to learn how to use the Quiz Builder and add questions: [How to Make Your First Quiz](/tutorials/making-first-quiz/).
        !!! example "Sample Questions:"
            Question 1: How does your skin feel when you wake up in the morning?
            - Choice 1: Tight 
            - Choice 2: Normal 
            - Choice 3: Oily 
            - Choice 4: Combination 
            - Choice 5: Sensitive 
            Question 2: How does your skin usually look by midday?
            - Choice 1: Still tight 
            - Choice 2: Same as in the morning 
            - Choice 3: Shiny 
            - Choice 4: T-zone shiny 
            - Choice 5: Red and irritated 
    ## Assign Variables to Choices
    Now it‚Äôs time to assign variables and scores to each choice.
    1. Click on a choice to open the [Choice Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings).
    2. Scroll to `Scores & Calculations` and add a new variable.
    3. To create a new variable, click on the `Search or create variable` search bar and start typing the name of the variable you want to create (e.g. `dry_skin`, `normal_skin`, `oily_skin`, etc.). Once you've typed the full name, a dropdown will appear that will allow you to `Create a new variable "xxx"`. Click on it to add a new variable.
    4. Assign a score of 1 to the matching variable.
    5. Repeat the process for each choice in that question and move on to the next question in your quiz.
        !!! note
            In the end, the variable with the highest total score will be used to determine the result.
        !!! example "Sample Scores & Variables:"
            Question 1: How does your skin feel when you wake up in the morning?
            - Choice 1: Tight (variable `dry_skin` +1)
            - Choice 2: Normal (variable `normal_skin` +1)
            - Choice 3: Oily (variable `oily_skin` +1)
            - Choice 4: Combination (variable `combination_skin` +1)
            - Choice 5: Sensitive (variable `sensitive_skin` +1)      
            Question 2: How does your skin usually look by midday?
            - Choice 1: Still tight (variable `dry_skin` +1)
            - Choice 2: Same as in the morning (variable `normal_skin` +1)
            - Choice 3: Shiny (variable `oily_skin` +1)
            - Choice 4: T-zone shiny (variable `combination_skin` +1)
            - Choice 5: Red and irritated (variable `sensitive_skin` +1)
    ## Add Sections to Results Page
    Now let‚Äôs edit the Results Page.
    1. Head over to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/).
    2. Click `+ Add section` to add a new section to your results page.
    3. Add five different sections ‚Äî one for each skin type.
    4. In each section, add:
        - A [heading](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#heading),
        - A short [text description](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#text) of what that means,
        - A [Product Block](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/.#products-products-variants-collections)
    5. In the [Product Block settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections), choose the Recommendations System to be `Fixed Recommendations`.
    6. In the [Product Slot](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#product-slot) settings, select the `Max. recommended items` and click on `Select products` to manually select the products that match that skin type.
    7. Repeat the process for each skin type section.
    ## Add Display Logic
    Now let‚Äôs tell the app *when* to show each section.
    1. Click a specific section to open the `Results Section` settings.
    2. Go to [Display Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#display-logic) and click `+ Add condition (OR)`.
    3. Show the section if the corresponding variable has the highest score (e.g., dry skin). Ensure default visibility is set to hidden for all sections until conditions are met.  
        Set the conditions like this:
        - IF `the variable with the highest score` `IS` `dry_skin` THEN this section is VISIBLE.
        - Default visibility should be `HIDDEN`.
    4. Repeat this for each skin type section using their corresponding variable.
        !!! example "Sample Display Logic:"
            - IF `the variable with the highest score` `IS` `dry_skin` THEN this section is VISIBLE. Default visibility should be `HIDDEN`.
            - IF `the variable with the highest score` `IS` `normal_skin` THEN this section is VISIBLE. Default visibility should be `HIDDEN`.
            - IF `the variable with the highest score` `IS` `oily_skin` THEN this section is VISIBLE. Default visibility should be `HIDDEN`.
            - IF `the variable with the highest score` `IS` `combination_skin` THEN this section is VISIBLE. Default visibility should be `HIDDEN`.
            - IF `the variable with the highest score` `IS` `sensitive_skin` THEN this section is VISIBLE. Default visibility should be `HIDDEN`.
    5. Save the changes with the `Save` button.
    ## Preview
    Once everything‚Äôs set up, click `Preview` to test your quiz.
    Choose different answers to simulate different skin types, and make sure the correct section and products are shown on the results page.
    ## Troubleshoot Results
    If you see the wrong result, double-check your variables and scoring in the [Questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) tab.
    If you need help debugging, go to the [Responses](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) tab and open [Analysis](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#response-analysis).
    This section:
    - shows you which variables were scored during a quiz session and in which answer,
    - shows logic behind sections visibility,
    - gives you an overview of the quiz results,
    - gives you access to [Quiz Copilot](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#quiz-copilot), an AI assistant that can help you analyze the response.
    You can adjust scores or questions based on the analysis.
    ## Publish the Quiz as Link Button
    In Shopify, you can make the quiz appear as a popup by simply linking a button or menu item to `#quiz`.
    1. Set the quiz as default by going to the [Dashboard](/reference/dashboard/) and clicking on the `Set as default` button.
    2. Head over to the [Publish](/reference/quiz-builder/share-publish/) tab and check the `Add the quiz as a link triggered pop-up` option for step-bystep instructions on how to do this.
    3. In Shopify, go to `Online Store > Themes`, and click `Customize` on your current theme.
    4. Go to `App Embeds` in the left sidebar. Find the `Link Popup Quiz` by Rand make sure it‚Äôs toggled on.  This will load the quiz script and allow it to open in a popup when the link is clicked.

    6. Edit the section heading and the text on the button.

        !!! warning
            Don't link the full URL to the quiz like `https://your-store.com/#quiz`. Otherwise, the quiz will not open. Instead, use the `#quiz` hash only.
    8. Once done, click `Save`.
