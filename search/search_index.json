This is especially true for stores whose survival relies on transforming their site visitors from casual browsers into committed customers.</p> <p>Over the past few years, eCommerce sales funnels have emerged as one of the fastest ways to get more sales, increase <code>Average Order Value</code> and sell more products to every visitor.</p> <p></p> <p>You\u2019ve probably seen the above visual representation of an eCommerce sales funnel a thousand times. Marketers use them all the time. As you get closer to a sale, the number of people that go to the next step decreases.</p> <p>Main advantages of having a sales funnel are:</p> <p>\u2013 Increased sales through better targeting. Sales funnels advise customers on finding the right products for them and help them make confident purchasing decisions.</p> <p>\u2013 Getting to know your customers. During different steps of the funnel, you\u2019ll have the chance to collect actionable data about your customers and define your buyer personas, while considering demographics, customer motivation, behavior patterns, and goals. This information will help you when retargeting customers with segmented marketing campaigns.</p> <p>\u2013 Building long term relationships with your audience. Only 2% of shoppers typically convert on their first visit to an eCommerce store. However, with the right incentives, it\u2019s easy to capture new visitors\u2019 emails. This way you can start building a relationship with them and you can close more sales further down the road.</p> <p>The process of creating a sales funnel has come a long way, too. Building a sales funnel used to take weeks, require tons of custom coding, and a whole team of developers. These days, thanks to a few apps, it\u2019s now possible to have it up and running in a few hours.</p> <p>A well-built sales funnel can be a powerful foundation to build your eCommerce business on. Unfortunately, the out-of-the-box solution doesn\u2019t come with many common sales funnel features, like conversion quizzes, one-click upsells, order bumps, and even custom sales pages. However, there are many upsell apps available that help to boost conversion rate and increase revenue with different selling strategies.</p> <p>RevenueHunt</p> <p>RevenueHunt specializes in building sales funnels for established eCommerce businesses. As a Shopify Partner we focus on working specifically with Shopify stores. We\u2019re specialists in creating funnels designed both to grow your email list and to drive your sales.</p> <p>In this article I\u2019m going to show you how to build a sales funnel that works seamlessly on Shopify to boost conversions for your eCommerce store.

It\u2019s conformed by a number of steps designed to guide shoppers toward a buying decision.** These steps include marketing assets that actually do the selling for you (eg. quizzes, emails and landing pages).</p> <p>No sales funnel, no sales</p> <p>Not having a sales funnel and driving paid traffic to your store is like approaching a complete stranger in the street and pitching them a $149 product.

Not only that, but they also share current promotions and sales, discuss complementary items and walk you through the checkout process.</p> <p>That\u2019s the effect a well-constructed sales funnel can have on your eCommerce store: recreating the \u201cpersonal shopper\u201d experience for your online customers.

Measuring your repeat purchase rate is an excellent way of evaluating how well your retention strategy is actually working.

Let\u2019s say that you are on a Basic plan which allows up to 500 responses per month. These are the number of responses you\u2019ve gotten in the last 30 days:</p> <p></p> <p>So:</p> <ul> <li>On day 1, you got 32 answers</li> <li>On day 2 you got 16 answers</li> <li>On day 3 you got 0 answers, (so none at all) and so on.</li> </ul> <p>If you check the \u201cTotal last 30 days\u201d cell, that\u2019s where we add the number of responses of the last 30 days.

We don\u2019t set a date on which we begin or end measuring, rather, we always measure the last 30 days, rolling.</p> <p>If you pay on the 15th for a Basic plan, you have the ability to get 500 responses within the past 30 days. For example, on the 15th we will look back 30 days and we will count the number of responses you\u2019ve received those days. On the 22nd, we will look back 30 days, and so on\u2026  Take a look at the spreadsheet explanation above.</p> <p>In this example, if you pay on May 15th the Basic plan, and you have a surge of responses let\u2019s say on the 10th \u2013 28th of a month, the following will happen:</p> <ol> <li>As soon as you\u2019re near 90% of your plan\u2019s usage (in the Basic plan, this means when you\u2019ve accumulated 450 responses in the last 30 days) we will warn you and let you know you might reach 100% which will require upgrading your plan.</li> <li>If the usage keeps being high and you cross your plan\u2019s limit, we will also let you know. As mentioned before, we will never block your quiz immediately, you\u2019ll have plenty of time to do so.</li> <li>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re now over your Basic plan, as you have been receiving a lot of responses that make you stay over 500 responses (to learn how the responses accumulate, please check the article thread above). But you already got charged again for the Basic plan, as the 15th of the month has passed. Let\u2019s say that we\u2019re on the 20th of a month here.</li> </ol> <p>This means that, if you upgrade immediately to a Pro plan (allows 1000 responses/30 days), Shopify will only charge for 6 days of your plan (as that\u2019s how many days you\u2019ve used your Basic plan since the 15th). Your new billing cycle will be on the 20th of each month. Now, you\u2019re able to receive 1000 responses \u201cwithin the last 30 days\u201d on a Pro plan. If you upgraded on the 20th, we will look back 30 days, and we will count your responses. If you\u2019re under 1000, you\u2019re good to go.</p> <p>In other words: if the Basic plan accepts around ~16 responses each day, the Pro plan will accept ~33 responses every day, without ever crossing the 1000 responses limit / rolling 30 days (16 * 30 = 500, 33 * 30 = 1000)</p>"},{"location":"customer-success/plans-pricing-faq/#monthy-vs-yearly-plan","title":"Monthy vs Yearly plan","text":"ShopifyShopify (Legacy)WooCommerceMagentoBigCommerceStandalone <p>If you\u2019ve just installed the RevenueHunt app, it is advised to stay on a monthly plan for some time to check your quiz usage. </p> <p>Once you\u2019re sure of what your stable usage is in a month, you can choose to pay for a yearly plan upfront with a reduced monthly rate.

Low Completion Rate / High Drop Off - Make the quiz shorter, max. 5-6 questions. Customers are likely losing attention.  - Add more visuals to the quiz. Turn multiple-choice questions into picture questions. Add images and videos to your quiz. Visual quizzes have a much higher completion rate than pure text-based ones.  - Check your mandatory questions. Perhaps customers don\u2019t want to leave their phone number, name, or email.

Understand the Callback Function: Visit the FAQ page to learn how our callback function works and how it can be used for tracking custom events. 2. Embed the Custom Script: Add the following script to your store's theme where the quiz is featured (preferably sitewide in your theme's main template file):     <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;\nfunction prqQuizCallback(quizResponse){\n    gtag('event', 'your_event_name', {\n    'event_category': 'quiz',\n    'event_label': 'specific_label',\n    'value': quizResponse.someValue\n    });\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre> 3. Customize Event Tracking: Modify the script with appropriate event names, labels, and values to track specific user actions. For example:     <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;\nfunction prqQuizCallback(quizResponse){\n    // Track quiz start\n    if(quizResponse.type === 'quiz_started') {\n        gtag('event', 'quiz_start', {\n            'event_category': 'quiz',\n            'event_label': quizResponse.quizName\n        });\n    }\n\n    // Track question answers\n    if(quizResponse.type === 'question_answered') {\n        gtag('event', 'question_answer', {\n            'event_category': 'quiz',\n            'event_label': quizResponse.questionTitle,\n            'value': quizResponse.answer\n        });\n    }\n\n    // Track quiz completion\n    if(quizResponse.type === 'quiz_completed') {\n        gtag('event', 'quiz_complete', {\n            'event_category': 'quiz',\n            'event_label': quizResponse.quizName\n        });\n    }\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre> 4.

You can, for example:</p> <ul> <li>Create customer tags in your quiz to represent different quiz responses.</li> <li>Link these tags to specific answers in your quiz.</li> <li>Upon completion of the quiz by a participant, Mailchimp will receive all the tags that the customer picked based on their choices.</li> <li>In MailChimp, you can use these tags to segment your audience and tailor your email campaigns.</li> </ul> <p>Warning</p> <p>Mailchimp API only supports email, name, and customer tags to be send from the quiz. To override Mailchimp\u2019s limitation on pushing detailed quiz data, you can use customer tags to represent customer responses.</p> </li> <li> <p>Design Email Campaigns. Once the quiz answers are covered with customer tags, all the information you need about your customer will start flowing into MailChimp. That\u2019s when you can set up your email campaigns. </p> <ul> <li>You can start by setting up Automations (automated email flows) to trigger based on specific tags or quiz completions.</li> <li>Then, create different email templates in MailChimp that correspond to different quiz outcomes or automation flows.</li> </ul> <p>Example</p> <p>Imagine you run a skincare eCommerce store. Your quiz asks customers about their skin type and concerns. Based on their answers, you tag them as \u201cOily Skin,\u201d \u201cDry Skin,\u201d etc.</p> <p>In MailChimp, you create an email series targeting these tags. For instance:</p> <ul> <li>Day 1: Introduction to products suitable for oily skin. Check example here.</li> <li>Day 3: Customer testimonials and reviews for oily skin products. Check example here.</li> <li>Day 7: Special discount on recommended products for oily skin. Check example here.</li> </ul> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Test and Optimize. After setting up your email campaigns, test them with a test email and optimize them based on the results.</p> </li> </ol> <p>This article explains how to send leads to Mailchimp from your quiz created in the RevenueHunt app.</p>"},{"location":"how-to-guides/send-leads-to-mailerlite/","title":"How to Send Leads to MailerLite","text":"<p>MailerLite is a powerful email marketing platform that allows you to send email campaigns to your leads.</p> <p>This article explains how to send leads to MailerLite from your product recommendation quiz.</p>"},{"location":"how-to-guides/send-leads-to-mailerlite/#connecting-your-mailerlite-account","title":"Connecting Your MailerLite Account","text":"ShopifyShopify (Legacy)WooCommerceMagentoBigCommerceStandalone <p>Warning</p> <p>This feature is currently in beta and is not available for all stores.

Webhooks","text":"<p>If you're experiencing issues where a webhook response contains broken or invalid JSON, here's a step-by-step guide to help you identify and resolve the problem.</p> <p>Common Scenario: When using webhooks to send quiz data, the response may appear broken or improperly formatted. For example, you may see incomplete or misaligned JSON objects in your logs. This could result from an unexpected content type or header configuration.</p> <p>Steps to Resolve the Issue</p> <ol> <li> <p>Check the Content-Type Header:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Inspect the content-type of the webhook payload. </p> </li> <li> <p>Log the headers to verify the content type being sent. If it is unexpected, this could cause the payload to be interpreted incorrectly.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Example: <pre><code>Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Verify the Header Configuration:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Compare the headers in your app's webhook configuration with the expected content type in the documentation.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the content type differs, it may need to be overridden manually in your webhook configuration.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>\"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Override the Content-Type in the App Config:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Update the webhook configuration to explicitly set the correct <code>Content-Type</code> header.</p> </li> <li> <p>For example, change the content type to <code>application/json</code>.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Test the Webhook Connection:</p> <p>After updating the configuration, test the connection:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Disconnect the webhook.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reconnect the webhook and test it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ensure the webhook is properly activated.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Validate the JSON:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use a tool like JSONLint to validate the JSON payload.</p> </li> <li> <p>Paste the payload into the tool to ensure it conforms to proper JSON formatting.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Publish Your Changes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Ensure you click the <code>Publish</code> button in the top-right corner after making updates to the webhook configuration. </p> </li> <li> <p>Missing this step may result in the changes not being applied.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Retest the Integration:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Complete a full end-to-end test of the quiz, submitting valid test data (e.g., email address, phone number, etc.).</p> </li> <li> <p>Confirm that the webhook receives the corrected JSON payload.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>By following this article, you can set up your data flow with

For maximum conversions and sales, we recommend using only one results page.</p> <p>However, multiple results pages can be beneficial in certain scenarios:</p> <ul> <li>Personalized discounts: Show different discounts (or no discount) based on customer preferences or responses.</li> <li>Email collection strategies: Offer unique results based on whether the customer leaves their email address or not.</li> <li>Simplifying conditional logic: If you have a long list of similar conditional blocks, using multiple results pages can make it easier to organize and manage logic by giving each page a clear name.</li> <li>Special cases: Some businesses, like medical &amp; supplements companies, might use separate results pages to inform customers when they are not eligible for certain products, e.g., \"You're not qualified for X due to [specific reason].\"</li> </ul> <p>Carefully consider your quiz goals before enabling this feature to ensure it aligns with your business objectives.</p> ShopifyShopify (Legacy)WooCommerceMagentoBigCommerceStandalone <p></p> <ol> <li>Open the Quiz Builder.</li> <li>Go to the Results Page tab.</li> <li> <p>Scroll down and click <code>+ Add results page</code>.

You might ask them specific questions about their skin to narrow down their unique characteristics. Here\u2019s an example:</p> <p>Step 1: Add Questions to the Quiz</p> <p>Question 1: Oiliness \"How does your skin usually feel by the middle of the day?\" - Very oily, shiny all over. (Oily skin) - Oily in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin), but dry elsewhere. (Combination skin) - Balanced, not too oily or dry. (Normal skin) - Dry and tight all over. (Dry skin) </p> <p>Question 2: Sensitivity \"How does your skin react to new products or environmental changes?\" - Easily irritated, red, or itchy. (Sensitive skin) - Rarely reacts, even to strong products. (Normal or Oily skin) - Reacts sometimes, but not consistently. (Combination skin) </p> <p>Question 3: Hydration \"Does your skin often feel dehydrated, regardless of oiliness?\" - Yes, it feels tight and flaky. (Dry or Dehydrated skin) - Sometimes, especially in colder months. (Combination or Normal skin) - Rarely or never. (Oily skin) </p> <p>Step 2: Link Products to Choices</p> <p>Associate each answer option with the most appropriate products. For example: - Answers that indicate Dry Skin link to products formulated for dry skin. - Answers suggesting Oily Skin link to products designed for oily skin.  </p> <p>This setup ensures that the quiz product recommendation algorithm will automatically provide the most relevant product suggestions.</p> <p>Note: This part is easy. The most difficult part is displaying the right text that corresponds to the product recommendation.</p> <p>Step 3: Displaying Skin Type Text Results with Display Logic</p> <p>If you want to display a text summary, like \"You have Dry/Oily/Combination/Normal skin,\" use Display Logic to conditionally show content blocks based on customer answers.  </p> <p>Example Setup:</p> <p>1\ufe0f\u20e3 Add Content Blocks to Results Page </p> <p>Create content blocks on your results page for each skin type. For example:  </p> <ul> <li>You have Dry Skin </li> <li>You have Oily Skin </li> <li>You have Combination Skin </li> <li>You have Normal Skin </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>2\ufe0f\u20e3 Configure Display Logic Rules </p> <p>Set Display Logic rules for when each block should appear, based on the answers.  </p> <p>For Dry Skin: - If the answer to Question 1: Oiliness is Dry and tight all over. - AND the answer to Question 2: Sensitivity is Easily irritated, red, or itchy. - AND the answer to Question 3: Hydration is Yes, it feels tight and flaky.  </p> <p>Then this block will be Visible; otherwise, it remains hidden.  </p> <p></p> <p>For Combination Skin: Combination skin may result from varied answer paths. You\u2019ll need rules for multiple scenarios:  </p> <ul> <li>If the answer to Question 1: Oiliness is Oily in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin), but dry elsewhere.  </li> <li>AND the answer to Question 2: Sensitivity is Reacts sometimes, but not consistently.  </li> <li>AND the answer to Question 3: Hydration is Sometimes, especially in colder months.  </li> </ul> <p>OR</p> <ul> <li>If the answer to Question 1: Oiliness is Very oily, shiny all over.  </li> <li>AND the answer to Question 2: Sensitivity is Easily irritated, red, or itchy.  </li> <li>AND the answer to Question 3: Hydration is Sometimes, especially in colder months.  </li> </ul> <p>OR</p> <ul> <li>If the answer to Question 1: Oiliness is Oily in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin), but dry elsewhere.  </li> <li>AND the answer to Question 2: Sensitivity is Easily irritated, red, or itchy.  </li> <li>AND the answer to Question 3: Hydration is Sometimes, but not consistently.         </li> </ul> <p>Then this block will be Visible; otherwise, it remains hidden.  </p> <p> </p> <p>3\ufe0f\u20e3 Repeat this process for all other possible combinations of answers.</p> <p>You will have to add similar rules to all the content blocks on the Results Page to show the right text in the end. This means you will have to predict every possible combination of answers a customer can make and add it as Display logic to ensure that the correct text block is shown. </p> <p>Simplifying the Process</p> <p>If configuring logic for all combinations feels overwhelming, you can try alternatives highlighted in this article, for example: 1. Base your logic on a single question (e.g., Question 1). 2. Use JavaScript to dynamically determine the skin type and display the result text.  </p> <p>This step-by-step guide will help you build a personality-type quiz tailored to your customers, making it easier to recommend the perfect products and deliver valuable insights.          </p> </li> <li> <p>Custom JavaScript: For a more refined approach, consider hiring a developer to create a custom JavaScript function. This function can show specific text tailored to the ID of the recommended product. Your developer could also add custom values to quiz choices and create a scoring system for the quiz to then display the right text on the results page. </p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Instructions on adding custom JavaScript to your Product Recommendation Quiz can be found here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Product Descriptions: Another option is to enrich your product descriptions with information explaining why each product is recommended. These descriptions are pulled directly from your store's product list. You can manage the visibility of these descriptions in the Results Page settings under <code>Individual Product Settings -&gt; Show description</code>. Additionally, you have the option to truncate these descriptions for better readability.</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <p>While our product recommendation algorithm works to recommend specific products, it will not automatically display an explanation of why a certain product was recommended.

Base your logic on a single question (e.g., Question 1). 2. Use JavaScript to dynamically determine the skin type and display the result text.  </p> <p>This step-by-step guide will help you build a personality-type quiz tailored to your customers, making it easier to recommend the perfect products and deliver valuable insights.          </p> </li> <li> <p>Custom JavaScript: For a more refined approach, consider hiring a developer to create a custom JavaScript function. This function can show specific text tailored to the ID of the recommended product.

These descriptions are pulled directly from your store's product list. You can manage the visibility of these descriptions in the Results Page settings under <code>Individual Product Settings -&gt; Show description</code>. Additionally, you have the option to truncate these descriptions for better readability.</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <p>While our product recommendation algorithm works to recommend specific products, it will not automatically display an explanation of why a certain product was recommended. It also won\u2019t automatically display custom text depending on the recommended product.</p> <p>RevenueHunt app doesn't have a linear score feature yet (as in every time a customer picks a choice, the \"score\" will receive one point and at the end, based on that score, different results pages will be displayed). For this reason, it can be very hard to build a \"personality-type\" quiz with our solution.</p> <p>If you want to show different text results depending on the recommended products, this functionality has to be built on the Results Page. There are a few ways to achieve it:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Information Recalls/Content Dynamic Source: Use Information Recalls/Content Dynamic Source to display a customer's answers within a content block or a text block on the Results Page. This method helps customers understand the rationale behind each product recommendation without any coding or complex logic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Display Logic: Display Logic allows you to show or hide text on the Results Page based on the customer's quiz responses. This method is suitable for shorter, simpler quizzes. For detailed guidance on setting up Display Logic, see here. </p> <p>Tip</p> <p>For longer, more complex quizzes, we advise using the custom JavaScript approach for optimal flexibility.</p> How to Build a Personality-Type Quiz? <p>Imagine you want to determine a customer\u2019s skin type. You might ask them specific questions about their skin to narrow down their unique characteristics. Here\u2019s an example:</p> <p>Step 1: Add Questions to the Quiz</p> <p>Question 1: Oiliness \"How does your skin usually feel by the middle of the day?\" - Very oily, shiny all over. (Oily skin) - Oily in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin), but dry elsewhere. (Combination skin) - Balanced, not too oily or dry. (Normal skin) - Dry and tight all over. (Dry skin) </p> <p>Question 2: Sensitivity \"How does your skin react to new products or environmental changes?\" - Easily irritated, red, or itchy. (Sensitive skin) - Rarely reacts, even to strong products. (Normal or Oily skin) - Reacts sometimes, but not consistently. (Combination skin) </p> <p>Question 3: Hydration \"Does your skin often feel dehydrated, regardless of oiliness?\" - Yes, it feels tight and flaky. (Dry or Dehydrated skin) - Sometimes, especially in colder months. (Combination or Normal skin) - Rarely or never. (Oily skin) </p> <p>Step 2: Link Products to Choices</p> <p>Associate each answer option with the most appropriate products. For example: - Answers that indicate Dry Skin link to products formulated for dry skin. - Answers suggesting Oily Skin link to products designed for oily skin.  </p> <p>This setup ensures that the quiz product recommendation algorithm will automatically provide the most relevant product suggestions.</p> <p>Note: This part is easy.

It enables the quiz creator to direct participants to different follow-up questions or content based on their responses to previous questions. This is particularly useful in creating quizzes that adapt to the user's input, offering a personalized path through the quiz.</p> <p>For instance, in a skincare consult quiz, you may start with a question about the participant's skin type (Dry, Normal, Combination, or Oily). Based on the answer, Jump Logic can direct the participant to questions specifically relevant to their skin type, thereby skipping irrelevant questions and tailoring the quiz experience.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>It is advised not to mix Jump Logic and Skip Logic in one quiz. Mixing logic rules can lead to unexpected results.</p>"},{"location":"how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/#conditional-logic","title":"Conditional Logic","text":"ShopifyShopify (Legacy)WooCommerceMagentoBigCommerceStandalone <p>In the Conditional Logic tab you can branch your quiz.
