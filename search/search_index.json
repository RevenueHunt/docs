This is especially true for stores whose survival relies on transforming their site visitors from casual browsers into committed customers.</p> <p>Over the past few years, eCommerce sales funnels have emerged as one of the fastest ways to get more sales, increase <code>Average Order Value</code> and sell more products to every visitor.</p> <p></p> <p>You\u2019ve probably seen the above visual representation of an eCommerce sales funnel a thousand times. Marketers use them all the time. As you get closer to a sale, the number of people that go to the next step decreases.</p> <p>Main advantages of having a sales funnel are:</p> <p>\u2013 Increased sales through better targeting. Sales funnels advise customers on finding the right products for them and help them make confident purchasing decisions.</p> <p>\u2013 Getting to know your customers. During different steps of the funnel, you\u2019ll have the chance to collect actionable data about your customers and define your buyer personas, while considering demographics, customer motivation, behavior patterns, and goals. This information will help you when retargeting customers with segmented marketing campaigns.</p> <p>\u2013 Building long term relationships with your audience. Only 2% of shoppers typically convert on their first visit to an eCommerce store. However, with the right incentives, it\u2019s easy to capture new visitors\u2019 emails. This way you can start building a relationship with them and you can close more sales further down the road.</p> <p>The process of creating a sales funnel has come a long way, too. Building a sales funnel used to take weeks, require tons of custom coding, and a whole team of developers. These days, thanks to a few apps, it\u2019s now possible to have it up and running in a few hours.</p> <p>A well-built sales funnel can be a powerful foundation to build your eCommerce business on. Unfortunately, the out-of-the-box solution doesn\u2019t come with many common sales funnel features, like conversion quizzes, one-click upsells, order bumps, and even custom sales pages. However, there are many upsell apps available that help to boost conversion rate and increase revenue with different selling strategies.</p> <p>RevenueHunt</p> <p>RevenueHunt specializes in building sales funnels for established eCommerce businesses. As a Shopify Partner we focus on working specifically with Shopify stores. We\u2019re specialists in creating funnels designed both to grow your email list and to drive your sales.</p> <p>In this article I\u2019m going to show you how to build a sales funnel that works seamlessly on Shopify to boost conversions for your eCommerce store.

It\u2019s conformed by a number of steps designed to guide shoppers toward a buying decision.** These steps include marketing assets that actually do the selling for you (eg. quizzes, emails and landing pages).</p> <p>No sales funnel, no sales</p> <p>Not having a sales funnel and driving paid traffic to your store is like approaching a complete stranger in the street and pitching them a $149 product.

Not only that, but they also share current promotions and sales, discuss complementary items and walk you through the checkout process.</p> <p>That\u2019s the effect a well-constructed sales funnel can have on your eCommerce store: recreating the \u201cpersonal shopper\u201d experience for your online customers.

Measuring your repeat purchase rate is an excellent way of evaluating how well your retention strategy is actually working.

Let\u2019s say that you are on a Basic plan which allows up to 500 responses per month. These are the number of responses you\u2019ve gotten in the last 30 days:</p> <p></p> <p>So:</p> <ul> <li>On day 1, you got 32 answers</li> <li>On day 2 you got 16 answers</li> <li>On day 3 you got 0 answers, (so none at all) and so on.</li> </ul> <p>If you check the \u201cTotal last 30 days\u201d cell, that\u2019s where we add the number of responses of the last 30 days. We get a total of 500 responses. This means your plan\u2019s usage has reached its limit. Thus, the \u201cAvailable Responses\u201d is 0.</p> <p>Now, when does this reset?</p> <p>Let\u2019s say, that the following day \u2013 you get 0 responses. The 30 days would \u201cRoll\u201d, and your table would look like this:</p> <p></p> <p>You\u2019ll notice that ALL of the days were \u201cbumped\u201d 1 day back. For example, \u201cDay 3\u201d on the first table, is now on \u201cDay 2\u201d, \u201cDay 4\u201d is now \u201cDay 3\u201d and so on. Meaning, the usage of day 1 has rolled out, and as you haven\u2019t got any new answers, now you have the 32 responses that you had previously on day #1 available \u2013 because the sum of your \u201cnew\u201d table is only 468 (As the previous day 1 with 32 responses \u201crolled out\u201d).</p>"},{"location":"customer-success/plans-pricing-faq/#changing-plans-example","title":"Changing plans example","text":"<p>For further clarification: billing cycle =/= our measuring period. We don\u2019t set a date on which we begin or end measuring, rather, we always measure the last 30 days, rolling.</p> <p>If you pay on the 15th for a Basic plan, you have the ability to get 500 responses within the past 30 days. For example, on the 15th we will look back 30 days and we will count the number of responses you\u2019ve received those days. On the 22nd, we will look back 30 days, and so on\u2026  Take a look at the spreadsheet explanation above.</p> <p>In this example, if you pay on May 15th the Basic plan, and you have a surge of responses let\u2019s say on the 10th \u2013 28th of a month, the following will happen:</p> <ol> <li>As soon as you\u2019re near 90% of your plan\u2019s usage (in the Basic plan, this means when you\u2019ve accumulated 450 responses in the last 30 days) we will warn you and let you know you might reach 100% which will require upgrading your plan.</li> <li>If the usage keeps being high and you cross your plan\u2019s limit, we will also let you know. As mentioned before, we will never block your quiz immediately, you\u2019ll have plenty of time to do so.</li> <li>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re now over your Basic plan, as you have been receiving a lot of responses that make you stay over 500 responses (to learn how the responses accumulate, please check the article thread above). But you already got charged again for the Basic plan, as the 15th of the month has passed. Let\u2019s say that we\u2019re on the 20th of a month here.</li> </ol> <p>This means that, if you upgrade immediately to a Pro plan (allows 1000 responses/30 days), Shopify will only charge for 6 days of your plan (as that\u2019s how many days you\u2019ve used your Basic plan since the 15th). Your new billing cycle will be on the 20th of each month. Now, you\u2019re able to receive 1000 responses \u201cwithin the last 30 days\u201d on a Pro plan. If you upgraded on the 20th, we will look back 30 days, and we will count your responses. If you\u2019re under 1000, you\u2019re good to go.</p> <p>In other words: if the Basic plan accepts around ~16 responses each day, the Pro plan will accept ~33 responses every day, without ever crossing the 1000 responses limit / rolling 30 days (16 * 30 = 500, 33 * 30 = 1000)</p>"},{"location":"customer-success/plans-pricing-faq/#monthy-vs-yearly-plan","title":"Monthy vs yearly plan","text":"ShopifyShopify (Legacy)WooCommerceMagentoBigCommerceStandalone <p>If you\u2019ve just installed the RevenueHunt app, it is advised to stay on a monthly plan for some time to check your quiz usage. </p> <p>Once you\u2019re sure of what your stable usage is in a month, you can choose to pay for a yearly plan upfront with a reduced monthly rate.

Because of this, uploaded images may crop or scale differently depending on the device.</p> <p>To ensure your uploaded images look great across all devices, we recommend:</p> <p>\u2705 Use high-resolution images of max. 1000px x 1000px size.</p> <p>\u2705 Avoid images with text \u2014 it might be cut off or obscured</p> <p>\u2705 If needed, keep important elements (like logos or text) centered</p> <p>\u2705 Use soft, neutral backgrounds that won\u2019t clash with quiz content</p> <p>\u2705 Test your quiz on different devices to see how the image behaves</p> <p>Remember, simpler is often better for responsive backgrounds!     </p> <p>Higher resolution images</p> <p>You can use Quiz Design &gt; Custom CSS console to upload  a background/split image for the whole quiz in a desired resolution.</p> <p>Sample code:</p> <pre><code>.lq-bg-img, .lq-bg-img-only, .widget .lq-bg-img, .widget .lq-bg-img-only {\n    background-image: url('https://your-image-url.com/image.jpg');\n    background-size: cover;\n    background-position: center;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Different images for mobile and desktop</p> <p>With Custom CSS in Quiz Design &gt; Custom CSS console, you can also uplaod different images for mobile and desktop. For this your developer can use CSS media queries to target different screen sizes.</p> <p>Sample code:</p> <pre><code>@media (max-width: 768px) {\n    .lq-bg-img, .lq-bg-img-only, .widget .lq-bg-img, .widget .lq-bg-img-only {\n        background-image: url('https://your-image-url.com/image-mobile.jpg');\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"how-to-guides/add-adjust-images/#image-blocks","title":"Image Blocks","text":"ShopifyShopify (Legacy)WooCommerceMagentoBigCommerceStandalone <p>You can upload an individual image via an Image Block directly into one of the quiz questions or results page.</p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Navigate to Questions or Results page tab in the quiz builder.</li> <li> <p>Click <code>+ Add block</code> to see a list of available blocks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click on <code>Image</code> block and a new block will be added to the question or a section on the results page.</p> </li> <li> <p>Open the Image block settings.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click <code>Select image</code> to upload an image from your computer or pick one from your in-app image gallery.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once uploaded, click <code>Change</code> to replace the image or <code>Remove</code> to delete it. </p> </li> <li> <p>Add in <code>Alt text</code> to make the image more accessible.

There are some workarounds mentioned in the article that you can try.</li> </ul> <p>Step 1: Create Quizzes in Different Languages</p> <ul> <li>Manual Translation: Begin by manually translating your quizzes into the desired languages.

However, note that questions and choices need manual translation.</li> </ul> <p>Step 2: Display the Correct Quiz Based on Browser Language</p> <p>Use JavaScript to show the appropriate quiz to users based on their browser's language setting. The script should:</p> <ul> <li>Detect the browser's language.</li> <li>Map this language to the corresponding quiz ID.</li> <li>Update quiz links and iframes on your site to point to the correct quiz version.</li> </ul> <p>Script sample code:</p> <pre><code>document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function() {\n  // Check browser's preferred language (get the first two characters to ignore region)\n  const language = navigator.language.substring(0,2);\n\n  // Your mapping of languages to quiz IDs\n  const quizMapping = {\n    'en': 'abc123',\n    'fr': 'dfg456',\n    'de': 'xyz423'\n  };\n\n  // Default language (fallback to English if not found)\n  const defaultQuizId = quizMapping[language] || quizMapping['en'];\n\n  // Find all quiz links and update the href\n  const quizLinks = document.querySelectorAll('a[href^=\"#quiz-\"]');\n  quizLinks.forEach(link =&gt; {\n    link.setAttribute('href', '#quiz-' + defaultQuizId);\n  });\n\n  // Find all iframes with quiz URLs and update the src attribute and the data-url attribute of the parent div\n  const quizIframes = document.querySelectorAll('iframe[src^=\"https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/\"]');\n  quizIframes.forEach(iframe =&gt; {\n    const newSrc = iframe.src.replace(/quiz\\/\\w+/, 'quiz/' + defaultQuizId);\n    iframe.src = newSrc;\n\n    // If the parent div has the data-url attribute, update it as well\n    const parentDiv = iframe.parentElement;\n    if (parentDiv &amp;&amp; parentDiv.hasAttribute('data-url')) {\n      const newDataUrl = parentDiv.getAttribute('data-url').replace(/quiz\\/\\w+/, 'quiz/' + defaultQuizId);\n      parentDiv.setAttribute('data-url', newDataUrl);\n    }\n  });\n});\n</code></pre> <p>Warning</p> <p>Make sure that you don\u2019t publish two quizzes on the same page, as this may lead to unwanted behavior.</p> <p>Step 3: Redirect to Translated Product URL</p> <p>Our application syncs only the base products from your store. Products translated into other languages won't have unique IDs for sync. Although you can change the quiz language, product names and descriptions will be displayed in the original language. </p> <p>A workaround for this could be creating quizzes in different languages and redirecting users to the translated product pages with JavaScript.</p> <ol> <li>Instead of adding a product to cart, you can change the checkout settings to <code>link to product</code> and point customers to the translated product page.</li> <li>By default, the customer will be redirected to the original product URL, but you can force an automatic URL change via JavaScript. </li> <li>For example, you can tell the Results Page to automatically change all the links from this <code>https://www.example.com/products/productA</code> to this <code>https://www.example.com/en/products/productA</code> This way your customers will be automatically redirected to the translated product page.</li> <li> <p>To redirect to an English translation of a product, one can use:         <pre><code>let shopURL = \"https://www.example.com\";\n\nvar links = document.querySelectorAll(\".lq-product a\");\n\nfor (let i = 0; i &lt; links.length; i++) {\nvar href = links[i].href;\nlinks[i].href = href.replace(shopURL,shopURL+\"/en\");\n}\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Make sure to replace the <code>https://www.example.com</code> with your store URL and change the <code>shopURL+\"/en\"</code> to the language code you have set up in your store (for example, <code>shopURL+\"/fr\"</code> for French).</p> </li> </ol> <p>While our application currently lacks native multi-language support, there are effective workarounds to present quizzes in multiple languages.</p> <p>How does it work?</p> <ul> <li>For now, it is possible to create multiple quizzes, each one in a different language. </li> <li>Then, each of these quizzes will have a unique quiz ID. </li> <li>You can embed each of these quizzes on a separate page on your store (eg quiz-en, quiz-de, quiz-fr\u2026) or have your developer create a script that displays the correct quiz popup depending on the browser language.</li> <li>However, the main problem is that our app can only sync the base products from your store (in the main language), as products translated automatically to other languages don't have unique product IDs that we could sync.

Understand the Callback Function: Visit the FAQ page to learn how our callback function works and how it can be used for tracking custom events. 2. Embed the Custom Script: Add the following script to your store's theme where the quiz is featured (preferably sitewide in your theme's main template file):     <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;\nfunction prqQuizCallback(quizResponse){\n    gtag('event', 'your_event_name', {\n    'event_category': 'quiz',\n    'event_label': 'specific_label',\n    'value': quizResponse.someValue\n    });\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre> 3. Customize Event Tracking: Modify the script with appropriate event names, labels, and values to track specific user actions. For example:     <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;\nfunction prqQuizCallback(quizResponse){\n    // Track quiz start\n    if(quizResponse.type === 'quiz_started') {\n        gtag('event', 'quiz_start', {\n            'event_category': 'quiz',\n            'event_label': quizResponse.quizName\n        });\n    }\n\n    // Track question answers\n    if(quizResponse.type === 'question_answered') {\n        gtag('event', 'question_answer', {\n            'event_category': 'quiz',\n            'event_label': quizResponse.questionTitle,\n            'value': quizResponse.answer\n        });\n    }\n\n    // Track quiz completion\n    if(quizResponse.type === 'quiz_completed') {\n        gtag('event', 'quiz_complete', {\n            'event_category': 'quiz',\n            'event_label': quizResponse.quizName\n        });\n    }\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre> 4.

Highly segmented campaigns return more than 3X the revenue per recipient as unsegmented campaigns.</p> <p>With Klaviyo you can create segments to filter your leads and assign email flows to each segment.

Webhooks","text":"<p>If you're experiencing issues where a webhook response contains broken or invalid JSON, here's a step-by-step guide to help you identify and resolve the problem.</p> <p>Common Scenario: When using webhooks to send quiz data, the response may appear broken or improperly formatted. For example, you may see incomplete or misaligned JSON objects in your logs. This could result from an unexpected content type or header configuration.</p> <p>Steps to Resolve the Issue</p> <ol> <li> <p>Check the Content-Type Header:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Inspect the content-type of the webhook payload. </p> </li> <li> <p>Log the headers to verify the content type being sent. If it is unexpected, this could cause the payload to be interpreted incorrectly.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Example: <pre><code>Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>Verify the Header Configuration:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Compare the headers in your app's webhook configuration with the expected content type in the documentation.</p> </li> <li> <p>If the content type differs, it may need to be overridden manually in your webhook configuration.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>\"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Override the Content-Type in the App Config:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Update the webhook configuration to explicitly set the correct <code>Content-Type</code> header.</p> </li> <li> <p>For example, change the content type to <code>application/json</code>.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Test the Webhook Connection:</p> <p>After updating the configuration, test the connection:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Disconnect the webhook.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reconnect the webhook and test it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ensure the webhook is properly activated.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Validate the JSON:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use a tool like JSONLint to validate the JSON payload.</p> </li> <li> <p>Paste the payload into the tool to ensure it conforms to proper JSON formatting.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Publish Your Changes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Ensure you click the <code>Publish</code> button in the top-right corner after making updates to the webhook configuration. </p> </li> <li> <p>Missing this step may result in the changes not being applied.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Retest the Integration:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Complete a full end-to-end test of the quiz, submitting valid test data (e.g., email address, phone number, etc.).</p> </li> <li> <p>Confirm that the webhook receives the corrected JSON payload.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>By following this article, you can set up your data flow with

For maximum conversions and sales, we recommend using only one results page.</p> <p>However, multiple results pages can be beneficial in certain scenarios:</p> <ul> <li>Personalized discounts: Show different discounts (or no discount) based on customer preferences or responses.</li> <li>Email collection strategies: Offer unique results based on whether the customer leaves their email address or not.</li> <li>Simplifying conditional logic: If you have a long list of similar conditional blocks, using multiple results pages can make it easier to organize and manage logic by giving each page a clear name.</li> <li>Special cases: Some businesses, like medical &amp; supplements companies, might use separate results pages to inform customers when they are not eligible for certain products, e.g., \"You're not qualified for X due to [specific reason].\"</li> </ul> <p>Carefully consider your quiz goals before enabling this feature to ensure it aligns with your business objectives.</p> ShopifyShopify (Legacy)WooCommerceMagentoBigCommerceStandalone <p></p> <ol> <li>Open the Quiz Builder.</li> <li>Go to the Results Page tab.</li> <li> <p>Scroll down and click <code>+ Add results page</code>.

You might ask them specific questions about their skin to narrow down their unique characteristics. Here\u2019s an example:</p> <p>Step 1: Add Questions to the Quiz</p> <p>Question 1: Oiliness \"How does your skin usually feel by the middle of the day?\" - Very oily, shiny all over. (Oily skin) - Oily in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin), but dry elsewhere. (Combination skin) - Balanced, not too oily or dry. (Normal skin) - Dry and tight all over. (Dry skin) </p> <p>Question 2: Sensitivity \"How does your skin react to new products or environmental changes?\" - Easily irritated, red, or itchy. (Sensitive skin) - Rarely reacts, even to strong products. (Normal or Oily skin) - Reacts sometimes, but not consistently. (Combination skin) </p> <p>Question 3: Hydration \"Does your skin often feel dehydrated, regardless of oiliness?\" - Yes, it feels tight and flaky. (Dry or Dehydrated skin) - Sometimes, especially in colder months. (Combination or Normal skin) - Rarely or never. (Oily skin) </p> <p>Step 2: Link Products to Choices</p> <p>Associate each answer option with the most appropriate products. For example: - Answers that indicate Dry Skin link to products formulated for dry skin. - Answers suggesting Oily Skin link to products designed for oily skin.  </p> <p>This setup ensures that the quiz product recommendation algorithm will automatically provide the most relevant product suggestions.</p> <p>Note: This part is easy. The most difficult part is displaying the right text that corresponds to the product recommendation.</p> <p>Step 3: Displaying Skin Type Text Results with Display Logic</p> <p>If you want to display a text summary, like \"You have Dry/Oily/Combination/Normal skin,\" use Display Logic to conditionally show content blocks based on customer answers.  </p> <p>Example Setup:</p> <p>1\ufe0f\u20e3 Add Content Blocks to Results Page </p> <p>Create content blocks on your results page for each skin type. For example:  </p> <ul> <li>You have Dry Skin </li> <li>You have Oily Skin </li> <li>You have Combination Skin </li> <li>You have Normal Skin </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>2\ufe0f\u20e3 Configure Display Logic Rules </p> <p>Set Display Logic rules for when each block should appear, based on the answers.  </p> <p>For Dry Skin: - If the answer to Question 1: Oiliness is Dry and tight all over. - AND the answer to Question 2: Sensitivity is Easily irritated, red, or itchy. - AND the answer to Question 3: Hydration is Yes, it feels tight and flaky.  </p> <p>Then this block will be Visible; otherwise, it remains hidden.  </p> <p></p> <p>For Combination Skin: Combination skin may result from varied answer paths.

You might ask them specific questions about their skin to narrow down their unique characteristics. Here\u2019s an example:</p> <p>Step 1: Add Questions to the Quiz</p> <p>Question 1: Oiliness \"How does your skin usually feel by the middle of the day?\" - Very oily, shiny all over. (Oily skin) - Oily in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin), but dry elsewhere. (Combination skin) - Balanced, not too oily or dry. (Normal skin) - Dry and tight all over. (Dry skin) </p> <p>Question 2: Sensitivity \"How does your skin react to new products or environmental changes?\" - Easily irritated, red, or itchy. (Sensitive skin) - Rarely reacts, even to strong products. (Normal or Oily skin) - Reacts sometimes, but not consistently. (Combination skin) </p> <p>Question 3: Hydration \"Does your skin often feel dehydrated, regardless of oiliness?\" - Yes, it feels tight and flaky. (Dry or Dehydrated skin) - Sometimes, especially in colder months. (Combination or Normal skin) - Rarely or never. (Oily skin) </p> <p>Step 2: Link Products to Choices</p> <p>Associate each answer option with the most appropriate products. For example: - Answers that indicate Dry Skin link to products formulated for dry skin. - Answers suggesting Oily Skin link to products designed for oily skin.  </p> <p>This setup ensures that the quiz product recommendation algorithm will automatically provide the most relevant product suggestions.</p> <p>Note: This part is easy. The most difficult part is displaying the right text that corresponds to the product recommendation.</p> <p>Step 3: Displaying Skin Type Text Results with Display Logic</p> <p>If you want to display a text summary, like \"You have Dry/Oily/Combination/Normal skin,\" use Display Logic to conditionally show content blocks based on customer answers.  </p> <p>Example Setup:</p> <p>1\ufe0f\u20e3 Add Content Blocks to Results Page </p> <p>Create content blocks on your results page for each skin type. For example:  </p> <ul> <li>You have Dry Skin </li> <li>You have Oily Skin </li> <li>You have Combination Skin </li> <li>You have Normal Skin </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>2\ufe0f\u20e3 Configure Display Logic Rules </p> <p>Set Display Logic rules for when each block should appear, based on the answers.  </p> <p>For Dry Skin: - If the answer to Question 1: Oiliness is Dry and tight all over. - AND the answer to Question 2: Sensitivity is Easily irritated, red, or itchy. - AND the answer to Question 3: Hydration is Yes, it feels tight and flaky.  </p> <p>Then this block will be Visible; otherwise, it remains hidden.  </p> <p></p> <p>For Combination Skin: Combination skin may result from varied answer paths. You\u2019ll need rules for multiple scenarios:  </p> <ul> <li>If the answer to Question 1: Oiliness is Oily in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin), but dry elsewhere.  </li> <li>AND the answer to Question 2: Sensitivity is Reacts sometimes, but not consistently.  </li> <li>AND the answer to Question 3: Hydration is Sometimes, especially in colder months.  </li> </ul> <p>OR</p> <ul> <li>If the answer to Question 1: Oiliness is Very oily, shiny all over.  </li> <li>AND the answer to Question 2: Sensitivity is Easily irritated, red, or itchy.  </li> <li>AND the answer to Question 3: Hydration is Sometimes, especially in colder months.  </li> </ul> <p>OR</p> <ul> <li>If the answer to Question 1: Oiliness is Oily in the T-zone (forehead, nose, chin), but dry elsewhere.  </li> <li>AND the answer to Question 2: Sensitivity is Easily irritated, red, or itchy.  </li> <li>AND the answer to Question 3: Hydration is Sometimes, but not consistently.         </li> </ul> <p>Then this block will be Visible; otherwise, it remains hidden.  </p> <p> </p> <p>3\ufe0f\u20e3 Repeat this process for all other possible combinations of answers.</p> <p>You will have to add similar rules to all the content blocks on the Results Page to show the right text in the end. This means you will have to predict every possible combination of answers a customer can make and add it as Display logic to ensure that the correct text block is shown. </p> <p>Simplifying the Process</p> <p>If configuring logic for all combinations feels overwhelming, you can try alternatives highlighted in this article, for example: 1. Base your logic on a single question (e.g., Question 1). 2. Use JavaScript to dynamically determine the skin type and display the result text.  </p> <p>This step-by-step guide will help you build a personality-type quiz tailored to your customers, making it easier to recommend the perfect products and deliver valuable insights.          </p> </li> <li> <p>Custom JavaScript: For a more refined approach, consider hiring a developer to create a custom JavaScript function. This function can show specific text tailored to the ID of the recommended product. Your developer could also add custom values to quiz choices and create a scoring system for the quiz to then display the right text on the results page. </p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Instructions on adding custom JavaScript to your Product Recommendation Quiz can be found here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Product Descriptions: Another option is to enrich your product descriptions with information explaining why each product is recommended. These descriptions are pulled directly from your store's product list. You can manage the visibility of these descriptions in the Results Page settings under <code>Individual Product Settings -&gt; Show description</code>.

Developers are encouraged to tailor the above callback function to meet their specific needs.</li> <li> <p>Store the Data: Confirm that the callback response is being correctly stored on your website. An effective method involves wrapping the redirection logic within the callback function itself. This ensures the data is mapped or saved before any redirection takes place. For example:     <pre><code>function prqQuizCallback(quizResponse) {\n// Code to map or save the data...\n\n// Then, redirect the user to the desired page:\nwindow.location.href = 'yourTargetURLHere';\n}\n</code></pre>     Choose an appropriate storage solution for the callback response, such as cookies, local storage, or even as query parameters in the URL, depending on your specific needs and the nature of the data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Access the Results Page First: The callback function is designed to trigger upon reaching the quiz's results page. This sequence ensures that the callback captures the quiz response, saving it as JSON in your website's local storage, before any redirection occurs. It's critical to ensure the results page is accessed even for a fraction of a second to allow this process to unfold correctly.</p> </li> <li>Customize the Function: Beyond merely logging the data, you might want to trigger specific actions based on the quiz outcomes. For instance, introducing a <code>prqAddOneToCartCallback(event);</code> function could be used when a customer adds a product to their cart directly from the quiz results.<ul> <li>There are several other callback functions you can utilize for more granular control and interaction with the quiz results.    <pre><code>prqSlideCallback(event);\n// triggered when customer responds to a question (slide)\n\nprqAddOneToCartCallback(event);\n// triggered when customer adds one product to cart \n\nprqAddedOneToCartCallback(event);\n// triggered when the product has already been added to the cart \n\nprqRemoveOneFromCartCallback(event);\n// triggered when customer removes one product from cart \n\nprqRemovedOneFromCartCallback(event);\n// triggered when the product has already been removed from the cart (only Shopify) \n\nprqAddAllToCartCallback(event); \n// triggered when customer adds all products to cart \n\nprqAddedAllToCartCallback(event);\n// triggered when all the products have already been added to the cart \n\nprqAppLoadedCallback();\n// triggered when the Product Recommendation Quiz app has been loaded \n</code></pre></li> </ul> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"how-to-guides/use-callback-function/#seeing-callback-function-in-action","title":"Seeing Callback Function in Action","text":"ShopifyShopify (Legacy)WooCommerceMagentoBigCommerceStandalone <p>For a practical demonstration of the callback function at work, visit the demo store at https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/.

If a product has at least one variant above the threshold, the product remains eligible for recommendations.</p> <p><code>Draft products</code> - this setting lets you control which products are eligible to be recommended in the quiz results based on draft status.</p> <p><code>Include draft products in recommendations</code> - When enabled, recommendations will include products or variants that are in draft status. Draft products could be recommended and will be shown in the 'Quiz preview' and under Responses &gt; Analysis. This setting is useful if you want to build your quiz with draft products and test it before publishing them. Draft products won't be displayed in the live quiz until they're published.</p> <p><code>Collection product order</code> - Control how products are ordered within collections for recommendations.</p> <p><code>Catalogue mode</code> - Choose between <code>Default (faster imports)</code> and <code>Preserve collection order</code>. </p> <p><code>Default (faster imports)</code> - When products have equal votes, they appear in random order. This mode imports your catalogue faster. </p> <p><code>Preserve collection order</code> - When products have equal votes, they appear in the same order as arranged in your Shopify collections. Products placed earlier in your collection appear first in recommendations.</p> <p>After changing this setting</p> <p>You must click <code>Import now</code> to apply the change. The new ordering takes effect only after a fresh import.</p> When to use Preserve collection order? <p>Enable this if you've manually arranged products in your Shopify collections (for example, best-sellers first or new arrivals at the top) and want that order reflected in quiz recommendations.</p> <p>When <code>Preserve collection order</code> is enabled products are imported in the order they appear in your Shopify collections and when two products have equal votes, the one placed earlier in the collection appears first. This works with both manual sorting and Shopify's automatic collection sorting (best-selling, alphabetical, price, etc.).</p> <p>For example: Imagine you have a \"Best Sellers\" collection with products arranged by sales:</p> <ol> <li>Product A (best seller)</li> <li>Product B (second best)</li> <li>Product C (third best)</li> </ol> <p>If Products A and C both receive 3 votes in a quiz:</p> <ul> <li>With Default mode: Either could appear first (random)</li> <li>With Preserve collection order: Product A appears first (position 1 beats position 3)</li> </ul> <p></p> <p><code>Metafields Namespaces</code> - We will import the metafields information for the following namespaces. You will then be able to display this information on the product's result page. In this section, we'll display a list of metafield categories found in your store. You can toggle the button to activate the metafields.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Follow this article to show metafields in the quiz: How to Add Product Metafields.</p> <p></p> <p>What information to pull from your products - Choose custom settings for your products within the app.</p> <p><code>Short/Long description in products</code> - By selecting one or the other you can choose which description of your products will be shown on the results page.</p> <p><code>Pass attribute information to result page</code> - Toggle to activate/desactivate. Once this option is active, the app will pass attributes to your results page. You need to run a catalog sync after activating this option. Follow this article to learn how to show these attributes on the results page once they are synced: How to Add Product Metafields.</p> <p><code>Use attributes as categories</code> - Allows you to use your store's attributes to group products into categories that can be then linked to choices via the Link Collections/Link Categories tab.</p> <p>To access the Catalogue settings in the standalone version of the Product Recommendation Quiz, open the Success Checklist or this link.</p>"},{"location":"reference/app-settings/#smtp-settings","title":"SMTP settings","text":"ShopifyShopify (Legacy)WooCommerceMagentoBigCommerceStandalone <p>SMTP Settings </p> <p>SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.

STARTTLS is a protocol command used to upgrade an existing insecure connection to a secure, encrypted connection using TLS (Transport Layer Security). It typically runs over port 587. You should check this if your mail server supports STARTTLS\". Note that this option is enabled by default, but you should untick it if your SMTP server does not support STARTTLS, as this could prevent successful connections.</p> <p><code>Enable SSL</code> - Check to enable SLL. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is an older protocol for encrypting connections. If enabled, your connection starts as secure from the beginning (unlike STARTTLS which upgrades after connecting). This is usually used on port 465. Only enable SSL if your SMTP provider specifies SSL. This option is enabled by default, but should be unticked for SMTP servers that don't use SSL encryption.</p> <p>Troubleshooting</p> <p>If you see an error check your SMTP settings with the help of a third-party tool such as Gmass or any other SMTP test site.
