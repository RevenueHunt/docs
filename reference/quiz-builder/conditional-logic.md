## Jump Logic

=== "Shopify"

    Jump Logic allows you to route customers to different questions based on their responses, send users to different results pages or even external URLs.

    ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogic](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogic.png)

    `Jump Logic ▼` - Click to Open the Jump Logic options and add new rules to this question.

    `+ Add another rule (OR)` - Click to add a new OR Jump Logic rule for the selected question.

    `+ Add another rule (AND)` - Add another Jump Logic rule. Adds a new AND logical rule.

    `bin` - Delete the current Jump Logic rule.

    `+ Add concurrent logic (AND)` - Adds a new AND logical statement to the same rule. AND conditional statements can be tricky, as both statements have to be true for the rule to take effect. For most quizzes, using the OR rule is enough.

    `Default destination` - Select a slide or URL where the user will be always redirected after this slide.

    !!! tip "Drag-and-Drop Reordering"

        You can reorder Jump Logic rules by dragging and dropping them. Simply click and hold on a rule, then drag it to your desired position in the list.

    ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogic_defaultdestination](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogic_defaultdestination.png)

    !!! example "Example 2"

        ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogic_exampleOR](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogic_exampleOR.png)

    !!! example "Example 4"

        ![manual_shopifyv2_jumplogic_example4_scorevaraible](/images/manual_shopifyv2_jumplogic_example4_scorevaraible.png)

        In the example if the score of the varaible `dry` is greater than or equal to number `5` AND IF the score of the varaible `dry` is less than or equal to number `7` after the customer answers Question 9 then the user will be redirected to the `Resutls page 1`.
