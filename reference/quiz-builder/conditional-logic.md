### Jump Logic

=== "Shopify"

    Jump Logic allows you to route customers to different questions based on their responses, send users to different results pages or even external URLs.

    ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogic](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogic.png)

    `+ Add another rule (AND)` - Add another Jump Logic rule. Adds a new AND logical rule.

    `bin` - Delete the current Jump Logic rule.

    `+ Add concurrent logic (AND)` - Adds a new AND logical statement to the same rule. AND conditional statements can be tricky, as both statements have to be true for the rule to take effect. For most quizzes, using the OR rule is enough.

    `Default destination` - Select a slide or URL where the user will be always redirected after this slide.

    ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogic_defaultdestination](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogic_defaultdestination.png)
