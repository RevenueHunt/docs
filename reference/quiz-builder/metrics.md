## Drop-off

=== "Shopify"

    The Drop-off data (drop off rate per question) is available by default in the [Analytics](#analytics) section of the Quiz Builder.

    ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_metrics_analytics_dropoff](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_metrics_analytics_dropoff.png)

    `Quiz flow and drop-off rate` - Counts of key funnel events captured during the selected period, and the drop-off rate for each step. This table shows how visitors move through your quiz ‚Äî from the first question to the results and checkout - and where they drop off. 
    
    `Origin` - The slide or question where respondents started a step in the flow. 
    
    `Destination` - The next slide or page they reached. 
    
    `Views`- The number of times this transition occurred during the selected time range. 
    
    `Drop-off` - The percentage (and number) of respondents who exited the quiz instead of continuing to the next step.

    !!! warning "How drop-off is measured"
        The drop-off rate is measured based on events, which are triggered whenever someone starts a quiz. Some of these start events can be blocked by adblocking plugins in browsers. If you see a difference between the number of quiz starts and the dropoff rate, that is because the number of quiz starts in the analytics tab is automatically adjusted by the algorithm to filter in also the starts blocked by the ad blocker plugin.

    !!! tip "Reducing Drop-off"
        A high drop-off rate may indicate confusion, friction, or lack of engagement at that step. Try simplifying the question, reducing required inputs, or improving the design and copy to keep users progressing.

        Check [this help article](/customer-success/reduce-dropoff/) to learn how to reduce your quiz drop-off rates.

    !!! note "Alternative ways to measure drop-off"
        You can also measure the drop off per choice or question by connecting the quiz to [Google Analytics](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) or [Meta Pixel](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/).
