            Description fields are very useful as they not only allow you to add extra text to the slide but also style it using the [Markdown](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/) language, embed images and videos using [Markdown](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/) or use [information recalls](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) to display the user's previous answers.

    - **Image** - Click `Add` to uplaod a featured image to the question. Image should be max 1000px x 1000px. An extra menu appears once activated. You can choose the image position and adjust the opacity.

            - Inject custom texts, images, and conditional UI.
            - Adjust layout dynamically.
            - Render custom product recommendations.
            - Redirect to a specific store page.
            - Fire tracking on specific steps (GA, Meta Pixel, etc.).

    - **Video** - Click `Add` to uplaod a featured video to the question. An extra menu appears once activated. You can choose the video position and adjust the opacity.

        !!! example

            ![how_to_join_slides_slides_joined](/images/how_to_join_slides_slides_joined.png)

    - **Custom JS Code** - Click `Add` to open a JavaScript console. Allows you to add custom JavaScript to the quiz question.

        !!! tip "Custom JavaScript"

        
            You can add custom JavaScript to **questions** and the [**results page**](#results-page-tab) to extend behavior and layout.

            **Use cases**
            - Inject custom texts, images, and conditional UI.
            - Adjust layout dynamically.
            - Render custom product recommendations.
            - Redirect to a specific store page.
            - Fire tracking on specific steps (GA, Meta Pixel, etc.).

            See [How to Add JavaScript to the Quiz](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) for implementation details and best practices.


    **Adding Media**

    You can add media into quiz questions in two ways:

    1. **Per-question media** via [**Question Settings**](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings): Upload a unique image per slide (background or split) or add a short **video** block for richer context.

        ![how_to_improve_image_quality_picturechoicequestions](/images/how_to_improve_image_quality_backgroudimagequestion.png)

    2. **Embed via Markdown** in text blocks such as question description or content blocks on the results page:

        !!! example "Markdown"

            - **Images**
            ```
            ![alt text](https://www.example.com/path/to/image.jpg)
            ```
            - **Videos**
            ```
            ![](https://youtu.be/0_tO8HgJiLQ)
            ```

    !!! tip "Tip"
        See [How to Add/Adjust Images](/how-to-guides/add-adjust-images/) for optimization guidance (dimensions, compression, readability).


    **Styling Text**

    For quick formatting, you can use **Markdown** inside text blocks (questions, choices, results).

    !!! example "Using Markdown"

        **Headings**
        ```
        # H1
        ## H2
        ### H3
        ```

        **Text styles**
        ```
        *italic*  
        **bold**  
        ***bold & italic***
        ```

        **Links**
        ```
        [link title](https://www.example.com)
        ```

        **Images**
        ```
        ![alt text](https://www.example.com/path/to/image.jpg)
        ```

        **Videos**
        ```
        ![](https://youtu.be/0_tO8HgJiLQ)
        ```


    !!! tip "Need brand fonts/colors?"
        Use [**Custom CSS**](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/#advanced-customizations-css) in the [Quiz Design](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/) tab.


    **Picture Choice Slides**

    You can add a Picture Choice question to your quiz, which will allow you to add an image to each choice in that multiple choice question.

    ![how_to_improve_image_quality_picturechoicequestions](/images/how_to_improve_image_quality_picturechoicequestions.png)

    - Open the Quiz Builder and click `+ Add new question`. This will open a list of available question types.

    - Select `Picture choice`. This creates a multiple-choice slide where each option is displayed as a clickable image. You’ll be able to upload your own image for each choice.

        !!! tip "Image size"

            For best results, upload square images up to 400×400px.

            Non-square images will be cropped automatically.

            To avoid distortion, you can resize or crop them beforehand using a free online image editor.

            All uploaded images are optimized by the app for faster loading.

    - Click `+ Add choice` to insert a new answer option into the block.

    - For each choice, click `+ Image` to upload an image from your computer.

    - Repeat the process by adding more choices until your picture choice question is complete.
