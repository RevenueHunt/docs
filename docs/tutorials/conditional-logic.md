## Intro 

=== "Shopify (Legacy)"

    In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to use simple [conditional logic](/how-to-guides/use-conditional-logic/) to give personalized advice. 

    A quiz can act as a professional shopping assistant. It can react to the answers given by the customer and provide valuable feedback. All it takes is a bit of logic. 

    In this Skin Care Quiz, there are four blocks of text. Each describes in more detail what a skin type needs in terms of skincare.

    With RevenueHunt app, you can show customers with dry skin certain questions (specifically targeted for them), while customers with oily skin would skip these questions. This can be done in many ways within the app.

    **Objective**: In this video, we’ll teach you how to show these texts using [Jump Logic](#jump-logic), [Skip Logic](#skip-logic), or [Display Logic](#display-logic) on the results page.

=== "Shopify"

    Conditional Logic controls the quiz flow, determining exactly which questions, texts, or results are shown to customers based on their answers. 

    This tutorial covers the three logic types: Jump Logic, Skip Logic, and Display Logic, with practical examples of each.

    **Objective**: In this tutorial, we’ll teach you how to show custom content based on customer answers using [Jump Logic](#jump-logic), [Skip Logic](#skip-logic), or [Display Logic](#display-logic) on the results page.

## Jump Logic

=== "Shopify (Legacy)"



    Let’s start with Jump Logic.

    1. To display text advice in the quiz, you’ll need a `Statement question`.
    2. Make it longer by adding a description.
    3. One statement will be needed for each type of skin advice.

    Now, how can we make only one block appear, instead of all of them, one after the other? We can use [Jump Logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/).

    1. Open the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab and select a question. 
    2. Let’s add the first [Jump logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) condition:
        - If the answer to `‘How does your skin feel on an average day?’` is `‘Dry and tight all over’` then *Dry skin* advice should appear. 
    3. Click on the `+` plus sign to add another statement that can be true. This creates an additional `OR` conditional statement.
        - If the answer to `‘How does your skin feel on an average day?’` is `‘Oily all over’` then *Oily skin* advice should appear. 
    4. The `OR` separator between conditions means that only one of these has to be true for the logic to work.
    5. Let’s add conditions for the *Combination* and *Normal* skin.
    6. To ensure the customer doesn’t see all four statements additional [Jump logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) should be added to each of them. 
    7. Click on a `statement` question.
    8. In the `Always jump to…` section, indicate the question or a page that should preceed it.
    9. Do the same for the other three statements.
    10. Now that all is set, let’s update the preview/live quiz with the top-right `Publish` button and test it with `Preview`.
        - First, select `Dry skin`. 
        - Now let’s go back and select `Oily skin`.

    It seems that everything works correctly, well done!

    You’ve successfully added Jump Logic to your quiz. Your customers will now be able to see this personalized advice whenever they take the quiz.

    !!! tip "Jump Logic - other use cases"

        [Jump Logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/) is a powerful tool. It can also be used to:

        - redirect the customer to another, external URL directly from the quiz,
        - create branching in the quiz to send the customer to different answering paths,
        - create branching to link different products to the same choices,
        - or send customers to different Result Pages.

=== "Shopify"

    Jump Logic is used to redirect users to different questions, results pages, or external URLs, based on their responses. 

    ### Branching the Quiz

    Jump Logic allows you to branch the quiz based on the participant's responses.

    !!! example "Example: Skincare Quiz that shows only the relevant statement based on the user's skin type"

        For example, you can create a quiz that asks the participant about their skin type and then based on the answer, you can redirect them to a different question or content.

        ![how to use jump logic](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_jump_logic_default_destination.png)


    1. **Add Questions and Follow-up Statements.** Create a quiz with a main question and follow-up questions or statement. 
    
        !!! example

            For example, a skincare quiz with a skin type question and four different texts based on user responses.

            ![how to use jump logic](https://loom.com/i/11c8cff2e27a451a8c8b40b348de4a42?workflows_screenshot=true)

            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness – we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that’s deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn’t experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin’s natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.
                
    2. Navigate to the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab and select the main question. 
    3. Click on the main question and open the [Jump Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) tab. Click `+ Add another rule(OR)` and set up a redirection rule.
    4. Set up the first redirection rule. It follows the format: 
    
        !!! info "Jump Logic format"
    
            IF the response to the question `Pick your quesions` `is/is not` `Pick the choice`, THEN go to... `Set the destination`.

        !!! example

            If the responses to `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Oily all over`, THEN go to... `Q8: SKIN TYPE: OILY`.

            ![how to use jump logic](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_jump_logic_rule.png){width="300"}

    5. Click `+ Add another rule(OR)` and set up the other redirection rules for the same question.

        !!! example

            - If the response to `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Dry and tight all over`, THEN go to... `Q8: SKIN TYPE: DRY`.
            
            OR

            - If the response to `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Not too oily, not too dry`, THEN go to... `Q8: SKIN TYPE: NORMAL`.
            
            OR
            
            - If the response to `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Oily in certain spots`, THEN go to... `Q8: SKIN TYPE: COMBINATION`.
            
            OR
            
            - If the response to `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Oily all over`, THEN go to... `Q8: SKIN TYPE: OILY`.

    6. **Adjust Default Destinations for Each Statement.** Click on each statement slide one by one and in the Jump Logic tab change `Default destination` to the next question in the pipeline, avoiding the other statements.

        !!! example

            ![how to use jump logic](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_jump_logic_rule2.png){width="300"}
    
            - Dry skin type → Default destination: Next question (Q8: SKIN CONCERNS)

            OR

            - Combination skin type → Default destination: Next question (Q8: SKIN CONCERNS)

            OR

            - Normal skin type → Default destination: Next question (Q8: SKIN CONCERNS)

            OR

            - Oily skin type → Default destination: Next question (Q8: SKIN CONCERNS).
    
            ![how to use jump logic](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_jump_logic_default_destination.png)

    7. **Save & Test the Logic.** Save changes with the top-right `Save` button and `Preview` the quiz. Test each skin type option to ensure correct text is displayed.



    ### Redirecting to different Results Pages

    With Jump Logic, you can send users to different results pages based on their answers.

    !!! example "Example: Skincare Quiz that sends users to different results pages based on their answers"

        For example, you can create a quiz that asks the participant about their skin type and then based on the answer, you can redirect them to a different results page with custom content relevant to their skin type.

    1. Set up Multiple Result Pages in your quiz. 
    
        !!! tip
            Check out this [guide](/how-to-guides/set-multiple-result-pages/) to learn how to create multiple result pages.
    2. Go to the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab.
    3. Pick the question you want to add redirect logic to.
    4. Click on that question and open the `Jump Logic` tab.
    5. Click `+ Add another rule(OR)` and set up a redirection rule.

        !!! info "Jump Logic format"
    
            IF the response to the question `Pick your quesions` `is/is not` `Pick the choice`, THEN go to... `Set the destination`.

        !!! example

            IF the response to the question `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Oily all over`, THEN go to... `Results Page 2`.

    6. Click `+ Add another rule(OR)` and set up the other redirection rules for the same question.


        !!! example

            IF the response to the question `Q1: What is your skin type?` is `Dry`, then go to `Results Page 1`.

            OR

            IF the response to the question `Q1: What is your skin type?` is `Oily`, then go to `Results Page 2`.

            OR

            IF the response to the question `Q1: What is your skin type?` is `Normal`, then go to `Results Page 3`.

            OR

            IF the response to the question `Q1: What is your skin type?` is `Combination`, then go to `Results Page 4`.

            ![send users to different results pages jump logic](https://loom.com/i/cf75df4cb4574b2ab7f4b81eff37c83e?workflows_screenshot=true)

    7. Click the top-right `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz. Preview the quiz with the top-right `Preview` button and test the logic.

    ### Redirecting to an External URL

    With Jump Logic, you can send users to an external URL based on their answers.

    !!! example "Example: Skincare Quiz that sends users to an external URL based on their answers"

        For example, you can create a quiz that asks the participant about their allergies and then based on the answer, you can redirect them to an external URL with custom content explaining the allergens in your products.

    1. Go to the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab.
    2. Pick the question you want to add redirect logic to.
    3. Click on that question and open the [Jump Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) tab.
    4. Click `+ Add another rule(OR)` and set up a redirection rule and `Link to URL`.

        !!! info "Jump Logic format"
    
            IF the response to the question `Pick your quesions` `is/is not` `Pick the choice`, THEN go to... `Link to URL`.

        !!! example

            IF the answer to the question `Q10: ALERGIES` is `Rose`, THEN go to... `Link to URL` and paste the desired URL, for example `https://yourstore.com/alergies`.

            
             ![how to send users to an external url jump logic](https://loom.com/i/87753ed6e35d45ee8f0abfb0d1c3c92b?workflows_screenshot=true)

        !!! tip "Tip: Always redirect to URL after a question"

            To always redirect users to a specific page after a certain question, you can set up a `Default destination` rule. 
            
            1. Click on a question and open the [Jump Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) tab. 
            2. In the `Default destination` section, select `Link to URL` and paste the desired URL, for example `https://yourstore.com/`. 
            3. This way users will be redirected to the desired page after answering the question.

    6. Click the top-right `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz. Preview the quiz with the top-right `Preview` button and test the logic.

    Now, how can we make only one block appear, instead of all of them, one after the other? We can use [Jump Logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/).

    1. Open the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab and select a question. 
    2. Let’s add the first [Jump logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) condition:
        - If the answer to `‘How does your skin feel on an average day?’` is `‘Dry and tight all over’` then *Dry skin* advice should appear. 
    3. Click on the `+` plus sign to add another statement that can be true. This creates an additional `OR` conditional statement.
        - If the answer to `‘How does your skin feel on an average day?’` is `‘Oily all over’` then *Oily skin* advice should appear. 
    4. The `OR` separator between conditions means that only one of these has to be true for the logic to work.
    5. Let’s add conditions for the *Combination* and *Normal* skin.
    6. To ensure the customer doesn’t see all four statements additional [Jump logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) should be added to each of them. 
    7. Click on a `statement` question.
    8. In the `Always jump to…` section, indicate the question or a page that should preceed it.
    9. Do the same for the other three statements.
    10. Now that all is set, let’s update the preview/live quiz with the top-right `Publish` button and test it with `Preview`.
        - First, select `Dry skin`. 
        - Now let’s go back and select `Oily skin`.

    It seems that everything works correctly, well done!

    You’ve successfully added Jump Logic to your quiz. Your customers will now be able to see this personalized advice whenever they take the quiz.


    !!! tip "Jump Logic - other use cases"

        [Jump Logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/) is a powerful tool. It can also be used to:

## Skip Logic

=== "Shopify (Legacy)"

    For linear quizzes, using [Skip Logic](/how-to-guides/use-skip-logic/) instead is recommended.

    To achieve the same effect you can set up your statements to be shown one after another.

    1. Navigate to the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab, select a question and open the [Skip Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#skip-logic) menu.
    2. Then, add a Skip Logic rule to each statement. For example, when selecting a *Dry skin* statement, the rule states:
        - If the answer question `‘How does your skin feel on an average day?’` **IS NOT**  `Dry and tight all over`, then this question is skipped.
        - This implies that the *Dry skin* statement will **NOT** be skipped only if the answer to that question is `Dry and thigh all over`. In all other cases, the statement will **NOT** be shown.
    3. Similar rules shall be applied to the statements about the *Oily*, *Combination*, and *Normal* skin.
    4. Once all is set up, make sure to publish the changes with the top-right `Publish` button.
    5. Let’s test the quiz with the `Preview` button.

    It worked! The correct statement is shown and all the others are skipped based on the skin type the customer selected in the previous question.

    !!! tip "Skip Logic - other use cases"

        [Skip logic](/how-to-guides/use-skip-logic/) can also be used to:

        - show or hide a number of follow-up questions,
        - show or hide follow-up content based on questions that allow multiple answers.

=== "Shopify"

    Skip Logic hides specific slides when they are not relevant, based on user responses.


    ### Skip Slides

    !!! example "Example: Skincare Quiz that shows only the relevant statement based on the user's skin type"

        You want to provide personalized advice based on the customer's skin type. Imagine creating a quiz that determines a personalized skincare routine. *Question 4* might ask about the participant's skin type, and depending on the answer, a different statement or recommendation about their skincare is shown. This individualized response is made possible by Skip Logic, which then continues the quiz based on the participant's specific path.

        ![how to use skip logic example](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_skip_logic_flow.png)


    1. Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add a `Multiple choice question` asking the customer about their skin type: Dry, Normal, Oily, or Combination-type skin. 
    2. Add multiple [`Statement` slides](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#statement) describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:

        !!! example "Statement Slides"

            ![skip logic skip slides statements](https://loom.com/i/11c8cff2e27a451a8c8b40b348de4a42?workflows_screenshot=true)

            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness – we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine that’s deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesn’t experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skin’s natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.

        !!! note 

            If we don’t add skip logic to the quiz, our statement questions will just appear one after the other, regardless of the choice we made. 
    
    3. To add [Skip logic](/how-to-guides/use-skip-logic/), you should go the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab and select the first statement quesiton that should be skipped.  
    4. Next, in the right-hand menu locate the [`Skip Logic`](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#skip-logic) section.
    5. Click `+ Add another rule (OR)` to add a skip logic rule to the selected statement slide. 

        !!! info "Skip Logic format"

            IF the response to the question `Pick your quesions` `is/is not` `Pick the choice`, THEN this question will be skipped.

        !!! example

            IF the response to the question `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Dry and tight all over`, THEN this question will be skipped.

            Meaning that if any other answer than "Dry and tight all over" is selected, then this question will be skipped.

            ![how to hide content with logic shopifyv2 skip logic rule](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_skip_logic_rule.png)
    
    6. Use similar skip logic rules on the other statements to ensure that only relevant statement questions appear based on the customer's skin type selection.

        !!! example "Skip Logic for other statements"

            IF the response to the question `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Dry and tight all over`, THEN this question will be skipped.

            IF the response to the question `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Not too oily, not too dry`, THEN this question will be skipped.

            IF the response to the question `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Oily all over`, THEN this question will be skipped.

            IF the response to the question `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Oily in certain areas`, THEN this question will be skipped.

    7. Click the top-right `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz. Preview the quiz with the top-right `Preview` button and test the logic.



    ### Skip Follow-up Questions (Multiple Selection Questions)

    !!! example "Skincare Quiz that shows only follow-up questions relevant to the user's selections"

        You want to create a beauty quiz where customers can select multiple areas of concern (acne, flaky skin, wrinkles, etc.) and then only see follow-up questions relevant to their selections. The goal is to display only the follow-up questions that are relevant to the user's selections. For example, if a user selects 'acne' as a skin concern, only questions related to acne should be displayed, all the others skipped.

    1. Use the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) to add a multiple-choice question that **allows multiple selections** (this can be done via the [Multiple Choice Block Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#multiple-choice)) and create several follow-up questions that match the choices in the initial question.

        !!! example "Setting Up Follow-up Questions"

            For example, if a Skin Concerns question has the following choices:

            - Acne
            - Flaky Skin
            - Wrinkles

            The following follow-up questions can be created:

            ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_skiplogic_example](/images/how_to_shopifyV2_skiplogic_example_logic_multipleselection_questions.png)

        !!! warning

            Follow-up questions should be ordered in the same order as the choices presented in the initial question. So if the first choice is 'acne', the first follow-up question should be the one related to acne, and so on.

    2. Head over to the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab and select the first follow-up question, right after the multiple selection question. 
    3. Open the [Skip Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#skip-logic) tab.
    4. Click `+ Add another rule (OR)` to add a skip logic rule to the selected follow-up question. 

        !!! info "Skip Logic format"

            IF the response to the question `Pick your quesions` `is/is not` `Pick the choice`, THEN this question will be skipped.

        !!! example

            IF the response to the question `Q9: Skin Concerns` is `acne`, THEN this question will be skipped.

            ![how to hide content with logic shopifyv2 skip logic rule](/images/how_to_shopifyV2_skiplogic_example_logic_rule_multipleselection.png)

    5. For each  subsequent follow-up question, add a similar skip logic rule.
    6. After setting up the skip logic, make sure to save the changes with the top-right `Save` button. Then, ` Preview` the quiz and test the functionality by selecting different options in the quiz. 

        !!! example "Testing Skip Logic Functionality"
        
            For instance, selecting 'acne' and 'wrinkles' should display only the relevant follow-up questions while skipping others. If 'tight flaky skin' is selected, only questions related to flaky skin should appear, confirming that the skip logic is functioning correctly.

## Display Logic

=== "Shopify (Legacy)"

    Logic can also be applied to the contents of your [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/). 

    With [Display logic](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/), you can show or hide elements of your results page based on the customer's answers.

    1. Let’s add four `Content blocks` with the skin type advice to your [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/).
    2. You can edit the block text with [Markdown language](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/).
    3. Now, how can we make only one block appear, instead of all of them? We can add [Display logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#display-logic).
    4. To do that, activate it in the lower right corner with the `...` button. 
    5. Let’s add the first logic condition.
        - If the answer to `‘How does your skin feel on an average day?’` is `‘Dry and tight all over’` then this block (*Dry skin block*) will be **Visible**. 
        - In all other cases, it will be **Hidden**. 
    6. Now, let’s add similar rules to other content blocks.
    7. Let’s publish the changes with the top-right `Publish` button and test the quiz again with `Preview`.

    You’ve now successfully used Display logic to show and hide content on the Results page.

    !!! tip "Display Logic - other use cases"

        [Display Logic](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/) is a powerful tool that can also be used to:

        - show different image results depending on customer answers
        - or show product blocks with different numbers of recommendations. 

=== "Shopify"

    Display Logic controls which sections appear on the results page, based on answers, variables, or scores.

    ### Add Scores or Variables to Choices

    Custom scores or variables can be assigned to choices in the quiz in order to set up a scoring quiz, personality type quiz, dosha quiz, etc.

    To add scores or variables to choices, follow these steps:

    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add your `Multiple choice questions` asking the customer about their needs. For example: age, skincondition, etc. if you are building a quzi that determines a skin type.
    2. Open the [Choice Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings).
    3. Find the `Scores and calculations` section.
    4. You can adjust the pre-made 'score' variable for each choice with the up/down arrows. You can assign negative values if needed

    7. Once a new variable is created, you can assign a score to it.
    8. Repeat the process for each choice in that question and move on to the next question in your quiz.

    ### Based on Customer Answers

    !!! example "Example: Show a different section on a Results Page based on the customer's answer to a question"

        You want to show a different section on a Results Page based on the customer's answer to a question. Imagine creating a quiz that determines a personalized skincare routine. *Question 4* might ask about the participant's skin type, and depending on the answer, a different text and recommendation about their skincare is shown on the Results Page. This individualized response is made possible by Display Logic.

    1. Add sections to the Results Page. Open the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) and add different sections.

        !!! example "Example: Results Page with four sections"

            The quiz has four sections on the Results Page for different skin types: Dry Skin, Normal Skin, Oily Skin, and Combination Skin. Without display logic, all sections would be visible at once.To show only one section based on user responses, display logic must be applied to each section.

    2. Click on a section title to open the Section settings. From the side menu, click `+ Add logic condition (OR)` to create a new Display Logic rule.
    3. Add a Display Logic rule for the first section.

        !!! info "Display Logic format"

            - **If** `The response to question` - Choose the `question` that determines the skin type.
            - **is** - Select the choice that corresponds to `Dry Skin`.
            - **THEN section is VISIBLE**
            - Choose `Default visibility` to be `Hidden`.

        !!! example "Example: Display Logic rule for the Dry Skinsection"
        
            - **If** `The response to question` - Choose the `question` that determines the skin type.
            - **is** - Select the choice that corresponds to `Dry Skin`.
            - **THEN section is VISIBLE**
            - Choose `Default visibility` to be `Hidden`.

            ![display logic example](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_answers_example1.png)

    4. Repeat the process for other skin types.

        !!! example "Example: Display Logic rule for other sections"

            - If the response to the question `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Dry and tight all over`, then the section is visible. Default visibility is set to `Hidden`.
            - If the response to the question `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Not too oily, not too dry`, then the section is visible. Default visibility is set to `Hidden`.
            - If the response to the question `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Oily all over`, then the section is visible. Default visibility is set to `Hidden`.
            - If the response to the question `Q4: SKIN TYPE` is `Oily in certain areas`, then the section is visible. Default visibility is set to `Hidden`.

    5. Publish the changes with the top-right `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz and test the setup. Preview the quiz by clicking `Preview` button and select different skin types to ensure only the relevant section is displayed.

        !!! tip "Advanced Display Logic Conditions"


            You can set multiple conditions for the same section in Display logic: 

            - Example 1: A section can be visible if the skin type is "dry and tight" OR if the age group is "teens".
            - Example 2: A section can be visible if both conditions are met: skin type is "dry and tight" AND skin concerns include "acne".

        !!! warning

            If your display logic depends on many different conditions, you can use the `AND` operator to combine them.

            However, using too many conditions can make the logic complex and difficult to understand. In that case, it's better to use a different approach. Consider building a quiz that is Based on a [Winning Variable](/tutorials/conditional-logic/#based-on-winning-variable) or a [Total Score](/tutorials/conditional-logic/#based-on-total-score).



    ### Based on Winning Variable


    !!! example "Example: Show a different section on a Results Page based on the winning variable"

        You're building a personality-type or Dosha quiz. You want to show a different text and product recommendations based on the winning variable. For examples, if the user chooses mostly A's, B's, C's, etc. a different section with different text and product recommendations is shown.

 

    1. Open the [Questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) tab and add Questions and Choices. 

        !!! example "Example: Quiz with five questions, each with five choices"

            The quiz consists of five questions, each with five choices.  Each question and choice should help the user determine their skin type.

    2. Assign varaibles to choices. Each choice is associated with a [custom variable and a score](#how-to-add-scores-or-variables-to-choices) via the [`Choices Settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings) section. 


        !!! tip

            To learn how to add scores or variables to choices, check out [this section](#add-scores-or-variables-to-choices).

        !!! example "Example: Assigning variables to choices"
        
            Each answer contributes a score of +1 to the corresponding skin type variable: 

            - Dry skin: `dry +1`    
            - Normal skin: `normal +1`
            - Oily skin: `oily +1`
            - Combination skin: `combination +1`
            - Sensitive skin: `sensitive +1`

            ![how to shopifyv2 use display logic based on variable example1 scores](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_variable_example1_scores.png)

            This scoring will help determine the user's skin type based on their responses.

    3. Go to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) tab and add different sections to the Results Page. 

        !!! example "Example: Results Page with five sections"

            The results page contains five sections, each corresponding to a skin type. Each section contains a heading, text and a product block to recommend products for that skin type.

    4. Make sure each section contains a [product block](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections) to recommend products for that skin type.

        !!! info "Product recommendations"

            Each section can display recommended products in a [product block](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections) based on user responses or fixed recommendations: 

            - **Dynamic Recommendations:** Requires upvoting products via choice settings to influence the recommendation algorithm.
            - **Fixed Recommendations:** Set specific products to always display for each skin type section by changing the recommendation system to fixed and selecting items for each block. Ensure to configure fixed recommendations for all sections to provide consistent product suggestions.

            Change the `Recommendation System` in the [`Product Block Settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections) to whatever best suits your needs. For a personality-type quiz, we recommend using `Fixed Recommendations` and selecting products for each section.

    5. To display the correct section based on the highest scoring variable, go to Section Settings, find `Display Logic` and click `+ Add condition (OR)`.
    6. Add Display Logic to the Section. Set up the rule like this:

        !!! info "Display Logic format"


            - **If** `The variable with the highest score` 
            - `is/is not` - `Pick the variable` 
            - **THEN this section is VISIBLE**
            - `Default visibility` is `Visible/Hidden`.

        !!! example "Example: Display Logic rule for the Dry Skin section"

            - **If** `The variable with the highest score` 
            - `is` - `dry` 
            - **THEN this section is VISIBLE**
            - Set the `Default visibility` to `Hidden`.

            ![how to shopifyv2 use display logic based on variable example1 display logic](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_variable_example1.png)

    7. For each section, set a similar rule for the visibility condition.


        !!! example "Example: Display Logic rule for other skin type sections"

            - If the highest score is `dry`, show the dry skin section.
            - If the highest score is `normal`, show the normal skin section.
            - If the highest score is `oily`, show the oily skin section.
            - If the highest score is `combination`, show the combination section.
            - If the highest score is `sensitive`, show the sensitive skin section.

    8. Publish the changes with the top-right `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz and click `Preview` to test the setup. 
    
        !!! tip "Testing the setup"
        
            Select answers that correspond to a specific skin type (e.g., mostly dry skin). Verify that the correct results section is displayed based on the selected answers.


    ### Based on Total Score

    !!! example "Example: Show a different section on a Results Page based on the total score"

        You're building a custom scoring or presonality-type quiz. You want to show a different text and product recommendations based on the score of a variable. For examples, if the user's score is above 50, a different section with different text and product recommendations is shown.

    1. Open the [Questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) tab and add Questions and Choices. 

        !!! example "Example: Quiz with five questions, each with five choices"

            The quiz consists of five questions, each with five choices.  Each question and choice should help the user determine their skin type.

    2. Assign varaibles to choices. Each choice is associated with a [custom variable and a score](#how-to-add-scores-or-variables-to-choices) via the [`Choices Settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings) section. 

        !!! tip

            To learn how to add scores or variables to choices, check out [this section](#add-scores-or-variables-to-choices).

        !!! example "Example: Assigning scoresto choices"
        
            Each answer contributes a score of +1 to the corresponding skin type variable: 

            - First choice: `+1 point`
            - Second choice: `+2 points`
            - Third choice: `+3 points`
            - Fourth choice: `+4 points`
            - Fifth choice: `+5 points`

            The total score helps determine the user's skin type based on their selections.

            ![how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_score_example1](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_score_example1.png)

    3. Go to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) tab and add different sections to the Results Page. 

        !!! example "Example: Results Page with five sections"

            The results page contains five sections, each corresponding to a skin type. Each section contains a heading, text and a product block to recommend products for that skin type.

    4. Make sure each section contains a [product block](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections) to recommend products for that skin type.

        !!! info "Product recommendations"

            Each section can display recommended products in a [product block](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections) based on user responses or fixed recommendations: 

            - **Dynamic Recommendations:** Requires upvoting products via choice settings to influence the recommendation algorithm.
            - **Fixed Recommendations:** Set specific products to always display for each skin type section by changing the recommendation system to fixed and selecting items for each block. Ensure to configure fixed recommendations for all sections to provide consistent product suggestions.

            Change the `Recommendation System` in the [`Product Block Settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections) to whatever best suits your needs. For a personality-type quiz, we recommend using `Fixed Recommendations` and selecting products for each section.     
    5. Come up with score ranges that should determine the visibility of the sections.

        !!! example "Example: Score ranges"

            - Dry skin should be shown if the score is between 5 and 7 (inclusive): `score >= 5 && score <= 7`
            - Normal skin should be shown if the score is between 8 and 12 (inclusive): `score >= 8 && score <= 12`
            - Oily skin should be shown if the score is between 13 and 17 (inclusive): `score >= 13 && score <= 17`
            - Combination skin should be shown if the score is between 18 and 22 (inclusive): `score >= 18 && score <= 22`
            - Sensitive skin should be shown if the score is between 23 and 25 (inclusive): `score >= 23 && score <= 25`

    6. To display the correct section based on the total score, go to Section Settings, find `Display Logic` and click `+ Add condition (OR)`.
    7. Add Display Logic to the Section. Set up the rule like this:

        !!! info "Display Logic format"

            - **If** `The score of a variable`  select the varaible `Selected variable` 
            - `is greater than or equal to` - `Number`- `Add your number`
            - **AND**
            - **IF** `The score of a variable`  select the varaible `Selected variable` 
            - `is less than or equal to` - `Number`- `Add your number`
            - **THEN this section is VISIBLE**
            - Set the `Default visibility` to `Hidden`.

        !!! example "Example: Display Logic rule for the Dry Skin section"

            - **If** `The score of a variable`  select the varaible `score` 
            - `is greater than or equal to` - `5`
            - **AND**
            - **IF** `The score of a variable`  select the varaible `score` 
            - `is less than or equal to` - `7`
            - **THEN this section is VISIBLE**
            - Set the `Default visibility` to `Hidden`.

            ![how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_score_example1_logic](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_score_example1_logic.png)

            This rule will show the section only if the total score is between 5 and 7 (inclusive).

    8. For each section, set a similar rule for the visibility condition.

        !!! example "Example: Display Logic rule for different skin type sections"

            - Show  dry skin section if score is between 5 and 7 (inclusive). Condition: `score >= 5 && score <= 7`
            - Show normal skin section if score is between 8 and 12 (inclusive). Condition: `score >= 8 && score <= 12`
            - Show oily skin section if score is between 13 and 17 (inclusive). Condition: `score >= 13 && score <= 17`
            - Show combination skin section if score is between 18 and 22 (inclusive). Condition: `score >= 18 && score <= 22`
            - Show sensitive skin section if score is between 23 and 25 (inclusive). Condition: `score >= 23 && score <= 25`

    9. Publish the changes with the top-right `Save` button to update the preview/live quiz and click `Preview` to test the setup. 
    
        !!! tip "Testing the setup"

            Select answers that correspond to a specific skin type (e.g., mostly dry skin). Verify that the correct results section is displayed based on the selected answers.
