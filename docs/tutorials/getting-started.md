Welcome to Shop Quiz!

Before you start collecting leads and generating sales, here is a quick guide to finding your way around the app.

## [Dashboard](ttps://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/dashboard/)

1. When you log in to the Shop Quiz app, the first thing you’ll see is your [Dashboard](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/dashboard/).  This is where you can find all the quizzes that you create.
2. On the right, you can see the [Success Checklist](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/dashboard/#success-checklist). It shows the progress you’ve made in building your quiz.
3. Click on `+ add new quiz` to create a new project. You can start from scratch, or use one of our pre-designed templates to get started.

## [Quiz Builder](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/)

This is where you’ll create your quiz.

1. Choose a question type by clicking on the `+` plus sign and edit it. 
2. Once you’ve added your questions, you can drag and drop to move them around.
3. To change [question settings](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#question-settings), click on the :material-wrench: little wrench icon. Here you can change things like making the question optional, or allowing multiple answers.
4. Then you can make your recommendations smarter by adding [logic](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#conditional-logic). Link questions to different result pages or send people down different question paths depending on how they respond. 

## [Quiz Design](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#quiz-design)

This is where you can customize your quiz design.

1. In the [theme gallery](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#my-themes), you’ll see some premade themes that you can choose from.
2. Or create your own design by clicking [Edit](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#edit-theme) in the top menu.
3. Edit the font, change the text colors, or add a background image. 
4. You can even add custom CSS code to make the quiz match your store’s look and feel.

All the changes you make will be saved automatically.

## [Link Products](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#link-products)

Once you’re happy with the design, you can add products and collections to each question. 

Shop Quiz works like a voting system:

- Products are linked to each choice. 
- When a customer picks that choice, all linked products receive one vote.
- After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the products sorted by the number of votes.


Make sure to also edit the [Results Page](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#results-page).

Here you can write insightful information for the customer,  select how many products will be recommended, or even group your products into slots to recommend a whole package. 

## [Share](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#share) 

Now you can publish the quiz on your website.

- Hit the `Share` button in the top right-hand corner to see all of the publishing options.
- You can embed a link to the quiz in your website’s menu, add a `take the quiz` button, place the quiz inline with your page content or make it an automatic popup for your store visitors.

The choice is yours. 

## [Connect](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#connect)

If you want to do more with your Shop Quiz, try integrating it with other tools.

- The [`Connect`](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#connect) section lets you see all our integrations. 
- To set this up, select a platform and click `connect`. 

## [Metrics](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#metrics)

The [`Metrics`](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#metrics) panel is where you’ll be able to analyze quiz responses.

- Scroll down in [`analytics`](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#analytics) to see a general overview of your results, like how many people viewed your quiz, how many people started it, and the number of responses. 
- The [`responses`](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#responses) tab lets you dive deeper into individual respondents to see how they answered each question.
- You can download all responses to a CSV file by clicking [here](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/download-quiz-responses/).
