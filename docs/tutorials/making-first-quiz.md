## Intro

So you're ready to create your first Product Recommendation Quiz. 

The most successful quizzes have two things in common. They are **short** and they are **informative**. You don't need a long questionnaire to turn visitors into customers. 

**Objective**: Let's say that you run a cosmetics shop and have a selection of cleansers for different types of skin. Let's build a short quiz to help your customer choose the best cleanser for them.

## Add a New Quiz

=== "Shopify"

    1. Let's add a new quiz from your [dashboard](/reference/dashboard/).
    2. [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) is where you'll create your quiz. 
    3. Click on the `+` plus sign and choose a question type. 
    4. You can edit the question and you'll see how it looks in the preview.
    5. To change [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings), click on :material-wrench:, a little wrench icon. Here, you can change things like adding a question description or an image.
    6. To make the quiz more personal you can add a `Name question` and recall the answer in other parts of the quiz using [information recalls (@)](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/).
    7. To select the best cleanser, you may want to know the client's age, skin type and the environment they live in. `Multiple-choice questions` may be the best way to find out this information. Let's ask about a skin type. 
    8. Finally, we should find out the environment they live in. To make the quiz more interesting, we'll use a `Picture question` here. 
    9. Don't forget to add an `email question`! That's how you'll collect valuable leads for your marketing campaigns. In the [question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings) you can make this one optional.
    10. Once you have all your questions you can move them around by drag and drop. 
    11. Make sure to keep the quiz short. Customers typically drop out after question 8 and almost nobody gets to question 12. There's power in simplicity!

        - When a customer picks that choice, all linked products receive one vote.
        - After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the products sorted by the number of votes.
        - If there is a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the products.

        - In the `Products block`, you can select how many products will be recommended.

Markdowns allow you to add **boldness** or *emphasis* to your text but also insert links, images, and videos. For more information about the Markdown language, check our [How-To documentation](/how-to-guides/) section.
    4. The [Result Page settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) allow you to further customize the quiz with a background image.
