    !!! warning "Shopify 1.0 Theme Compatibility"
        Quizzes created with Shopify V2 cannot be published on Shopify 1.0 themes. Shopify 1.0 themes do not support app embeds, which are required for the V2 integration. App embeds are a feature available in Online Store 2.0 themes, which allow you to add app functionality without touching any code. If you want to use app embeds, you would need to upgrade to an Online Store 2.0 theme.

    If you see the error message "The quiz you are looking for does not exist" when trying to embed a quiz, follow these steps:

    1. Ensure that you have activated the `Inline Quiz` in the  Online Store > Theme > Customize > `+ Section` > `Apps` and **not** the the legacy `Inline Quiz Legacy`.
        ![how_to_publish_shipifyV2_V1publisherrorinlinequiz](/images/how_to_publish_shipifyV2_V1publisherrorinlinequiz.png)

        If a wrong inline quiz is activated, you will see the error message "The quiz you are looking for does not exist" when trying to link to a V2 quiz. 
        
        To solve this simply deactivate the `Inline Quiz Legacy` and activate the `Inline Quiz` one. 
    2. Save the changes.
