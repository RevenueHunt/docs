    Automating the transfer of quiz leads to your Mailchimp account can help you improve your email marketing campaigns by segmenting your audience and sending them personalized follow-up emails. 

    !!! warning "Important Considerations"

        - **Limited Data Transfer**: Mailchimp integration only supports email, name, and customer tags to be send from the quiz. For more complex emailing/data needs, including direct product recommendations, consider using a different service.
        - **Alternative Services**: For functionality beyond basic data transfer, platforms like [Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/), [HubSpot](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-hubspot/) or [Omnisend](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-omnisend/) are recommended. These services offer more robust integration options for personalized follow-ups.

    Before you begin, ensure you have:

    - An active Mailchimp account.
    - A RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz that you wish to connect with Mailchimp.

    If you want to set up a post-quiz email flow with Mailchimp, you can follow the steps below:

    1. **Connect Your Quiz to MailChimp.** Follow the instructions in the [Send Quiz Leads to Mailchimp](#send-quiz-leads-to-mailchimp) section.

        !!! tip

            Remember to take a test quiz/preview the quiz leaving a sample email address in order to send first data to MailChimp and test the connection. You can use your real email with a +test1, +test2 to test different answering routes. For example, youremail+test1@email.com or youremail+test2@email.com.
    2. **Use Customer Tags for Segmentation.** Once your quiz is connected you should consider what data you want to send to MailChimp from the quiz. You can, for example:
    
        - [Create customer tags in your quiz](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/#customer-tags) to represent different quiz responses.
        - Link these tags to specific answers in your quiz.
        - Upon completion of the quiz by a participant, Mailchimp will receive all the tags that the customer picked based on their choices.
        - In MailChimp, you can use these tags to segment your audience and tailor your email campaigns.

        !!! warning

            Mailchimp API only supports email, name, and customer tags to be send from the quiz. To override Mailchimp’s limitation on pushing detailed quiz data, you can use customer tags to represent customer responses.
    3. **Design Email Campaigns.** Once the quiz answers are covered with customer tags, all the information you need about your customer will start flowing into MailChimp. That’s when you can set up your email campaigns. 
        
        - You can start by setting up Automations (automated email flows) to trigger based on specific tags or quiz completions.
        - Then, create different email templates in MailChimp that correspond to different quiz outcomes or automation flows.

        !!! example

            Imagine you run a skincare eCommerce store. Your quiz asks customers about their skin type and concerns. Based on their answers, you tag them as “Oily Skin,” “Dry Skin,” etc.

            In MailChimp, you create an email series targeting these tags. For instance:

            - Day 1: Introduction to products suitable for oily skin. Check example [here](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mailchimp-newsletter1.png).
            - Day 3: Customer testimonials and reviews for oily skin products. Check example [here](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mailchimp-newsletter-2.png).
            - Day 7: Special discount on recommended products for oily skin. Check example [here](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mailchimp-newsletter-3.png).
