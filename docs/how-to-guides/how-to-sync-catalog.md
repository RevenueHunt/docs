# How to Run a Catalog Sync

Having trouble linking your products and collections in the "Link Products" and "Link Collections" dropdowns? Or noticing that collections appear but with a product count of zero? This article will guide you through troubleshooting and manually syncing your catalog with the Shop Quiz app.

**Initial Sync After Installation**

- **Just installed the app?** Remember, syncing your store's entire product catalog for the first time can take a bit. Depending on your catalog size, expect to wait anywhere from **30 minutes to several hours** for the sync to complete.
- **Visibility of Products:** Only products marked as active will appear in dropdown choices. **Draft or Archived products are excluded** from the sync and will not be visible.

1. **Navigate to Dashboard:** Log in to your [Dashboard](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/dashboard/) and locate the [Success Checklist](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/dashboard/#success-checklist).
2. **Initiate Manual Sync:** Under the `SYNC PRODUCTS FROM YOUR STORE` section, click the `run manual sync` button. The sync takes about 30-60 minutes to complete depending on the size of your catalog.

You can manually sync your store **every 6 hours**. Additionally, our app automatically performs a sync every 24 hours to keep your catalog current.

For optimal results, make any necessary updates or changes to your store before triggering a manual sync. This ensures your latest product information is accurately reflected in the app.

**Troubleshooting Sync Issues**

- **Check Sync Status:** If your products or collections aren't showing up as expected, or if the product counts remain at zero, it's possible the initial sync is still in progress or has encountered an issue.
- **Contact Support:** Should issues persist beyond the expected sync time, please [contact our support team](https://revenuehunt.com/contact/). We can manually initiate a complete sync of your shop to ensure everything is up-to-date.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage your catalog sync with the Product Recommendation Quiz app, ensuring your products and collections are accurately linked and displayed.
