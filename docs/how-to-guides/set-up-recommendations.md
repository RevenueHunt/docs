## ‚úçüèª Voting System


Recommended for most quizzes. The voting system counts product "votes" based on customer quiz choices and recommends products with the highest votes.

!!! note "Use this method for:"  

    - Helping customers narrow down a large product catalog
    - Most quizzes, especially product finders
    - Your first product recommendation quiz
    - Quizzes without complex branching

### Funnel Quiz

The voting system counts product "votes" based on customer quiz choices and recommends products with the highest votes.

![how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_funnel](/images/how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_funnel.png){width=500}

Product recommendation algorithm works like a voting system:

- Product variants are linked to each choice.
- When a customer picks a choice, all linked products receive one vote.
- After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted product variants sorted by the number of votes. *If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty. If there's a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the order of products.*
- You can limit recommendations to a specific number of products or a minimum vote threshold.

### Funnel Quiz with Slots

The voting system counts product "votes" based on customer quiz choices and then recommends highest voted products based on a filter added to each slot. For example, you can recommend a full skincare routine with a quiz that takes into account the customer answers and shows the most voted cleanser, toner, serum and moisturizer arranged into specific slots.

### Funnel Quiz with Branching

Branch your quiz to show different follow-up questions based on customer choices. The algorithm counts votes only from questions and answers shown to each customer.

### Funnel Quiz that Skips Slides
