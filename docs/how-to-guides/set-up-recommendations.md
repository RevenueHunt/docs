## ‚úçüèª Voting System

!!! note "Benefits of the Voting System Algorithm"  

    - Most versatile solution that adapts to changes in your product catalog
    - Always recommends top products based on customer choices
    - Works as a funnel to effectively narrow down product selection

### Funnel Quiz

The voting system counts product "votes" based on customer quiz choices and recommends products with the highest votes.

Product recommendation algorithm works like a voting system:

- Product variants are linked to each choice.
- When a customer picks a choice, all linked products receive one vote.
- After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted product variants sorted by the number of votes.
- If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty.
- If there's a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the order of products.
- You can limit recommendations to a specific number of products or a minimum vote threshold
- Supports arranging recommendations into Slots to recommend complete product routines
