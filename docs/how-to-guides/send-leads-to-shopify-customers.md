# How to Send Quiz Leads to Shopify Customers

You can add new customers automatically to your Shopify Customers list every time someone completes the quiz. Once someone leaves their email in the quiz, their Shopify Customer profile will be updated with their name, email, phone number and [customer tags](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#customer-tags).

This article explains how to connect your quiz to Shopify Customers and build a Shopify Flow targeted at quiz takers.

!!! note

    If a profile with the same email already exists, it will simply be updated with the customer tags from the quiz.
    
    Customer tags are updated every time a customer takes the quiz.


## Change subscribed/consent status for email and phone questions

By default, all the contacts added to the list via the quiz will be marked as subscribed and their consent to receiving marketing information was given. You can change that in the email and phone questions settings.

1. To change the default Consent state and Opt-in level, go to the email or phone question in the [Quiz Builder](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#quiz-builder_1).
2. Open the [question settings](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#question-settings).

    ![how_to_send_leads_to_shopify_customers_consent.png](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_shopify_customers_consent.png)

    - Under `Consent state`, you can select either `subscribed` or `non-subscribed`.

    - Under `Opt-in level`, you can select either `confirmed_opt_in` or `single_opt_in` (pick this option if you only want to send the one results email to the customer).

3. Click the `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz with new settings.
