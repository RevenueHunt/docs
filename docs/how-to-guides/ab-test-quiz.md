# How to A/B Test Your Product Recommendation Quiz

A/B testing, or split testing, allows you to compare two versions of your quizzes to see which one performs better. 

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up A/B testing manually using your ability to create, duplicate, and edit quizzes in the RevenueHunt app.

Ensure you have:

- Access to the RevenueHunt app where you can create and edit quizzes.
- Basic understanding of [how to publish quizzes](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz/) on your website.
- Access to your website’s backend or a platform that allows you to edit HTML/JavaScript for traffic distribution (optional for advanced routing).
- Analytics tools or integration such as  [Google Analytics](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) or [Facebook Pixel](/how-to-guides/integrate-facebook-pixel/). to measure quiz performance.

## Step 1: Create Two Versions of Your Quiz

- **Design Your Original Quiz**: Create your quiz (Version A) in the RevenueHunt app, focusing on the content and design that you currently believe will perform best.
- **Duplicate and Modify for Version B**: Use the duplication feature on the dashboard to make a copy of Version A. Alter one or more elements (e.g., title, color scheme, question order) to create Version B. Ensure only one key variable is different to accurately measure the effect of that change. Remember to publish the changes with the top-right Publish button.

## Step 2: Publish Both Versions on Your Website

Deploying both versions of your quiz on your website can be done through simple or advanced methods, depending on your ability to modify your site’s code and the level of precision you require in your A/B testing.

### No Coding Solution: Basic A/B Testing
For straightforward A/B testing, we recommend publishing each version of the quiz on separate pages within your store. This approach does not require any coding:

- **Inline Quiz on a New Page**: Create a new page for each version of the quiz (Version A and Version B). Follow the [Inline Quiz on a New Page](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-inline/#embedding-an-inline-quiz-on-a-new-page) publishing instructions to embed each quiz into its respective page. 

This method allows you to directly link to each quiz version from different parts of your website or through external marketing channels.

### Coding Solution: Advanced A/B Testing
If you’re aiming for a more sophisticated A/B testing setup that involves randomizing which quiz version a visitor sees, you’ll need some coding:

- **Link Popup**: Implement a Link Popup method by creating a single entry point (like a button or link) that dynamically directs visitors to either Version A or Version B of the quiz. You will need to work with a developer to program the logic that decides which link to the quiz is shown to each visitor. Follow the [Link Popup Publishing Instructions](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-link/) for detailed steps on how to implement this solution.

By choosing the appropriate method based on your needs and capabilities, you can effectively publish and test different quiz versions on your website to gather insights and improve engagement.

## Step 3: Evenly Distribute Traffic Between Quizzes

To manually distribute traffic:

- For Basic Routing: Use two separate URLs for each quiz version and direct users randomly via your website’s links or promotions.
- For Advanced Routing: Implement a JavaScript snippet or server-side logic on your landing page that randomly serves Version A or Version B of the quiz to each new visitor.

## Step 4: Track and Analyze Results

- **Set Up Analytics**: Ensure each quiz version has tracking set up. By default, we track the quiz starts, completions, conversion rate, and drop-off in the [Metrics](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/) panel. For more advanced analytics, you can connect your quizzes to [Google Analytics](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) or [Facebook Pixel](/how-to-guides/integrate-facebook-pixel/).
- **Analyze Performance**: After a significant amount of traffic has interacted with both versions, analyze the data to identify which version achieved better performance based on your predefined goals (e.g., higher completion rates).

## Step 5: Implement Improvements

Based on the analysis, decide which version of the quiz is more effective. Implement the winning elements in your standard quiz and consider new variables to test in future A/B testing cycles.

## Tips for Effective A/B Testing

- Test one variable at a time to understand its impact clearly.
- Ensure you have a statistically significant sample size before drawing conclusions.
