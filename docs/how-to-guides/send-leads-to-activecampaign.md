    2. Select the quiz icon and follow the provided setup instructions. During the setup process, you will be prompted to enter your `ActiveCampaign API Token`.

    !!! note

        Note that the Quiz is only responsible for sending the raw data, you will have to configure a flow or any other custom event you wish to make with the data within ActiveCampaign in itself, and any questions regarding this process should be asked to ActiveCampaignâ€™s support team directly.

### Adding Recommended Products to Emails

=== "Shopify"


    Unfortunately, for now, the only information about the recommended products we were able to send to Activecampaign is the Recommended Product IDs. This is not enough information to display the whole list of recommended products.

    To show any products in an ActiveCampaign you may need to connect your ActiveCampaign to Shopify first. Then by adding a product block, you should be able to display products from specific collections. It could be possible to add multiple product blocks and have them shown or hidden based on the recommended product ID, however, this option has not been yet tested thoroughly.
