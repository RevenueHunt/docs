# How to Redirect Quiz to Another Page

In this guide, we'll explore several methods to redirect your customers to another page following the completion of a quiz. Below, you'll find detailed steps for implementing page redirection using various techniques within a quiz environment.

## Using Jump Logic for Conditional Redirection

Jump Logic offers a dynamic way to direct customers to specific URLs based on their quiz interactions. Hereâ€™s how to implement it:

1. **Navigate to the Jump Logic Section**: In the [Quiz Builder](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/), locate the [Jump Logic](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#jump-logic) settings.
2. **Configure URL Redirection**: Specify the URL to which customers should be redirected to. This can be set to occur after a specific question or based on selected answers.

3. **Publish & Test Your Setup**: Ensure that the redirection works as expected by publish the changes witht eh top-right `Publish` button and running through the quiz selecting the conditions that trigger the redirect.

*Note: Redirecting with Jump Logic does not transfer quiz data to this new redirection page. However, you can review the quiz responses in the Quiz Builder's Metrics section.*

## Redirecting to a Custom Results Page via Callback Function

You can use our [callback function](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/use-callback-function/) to redirect the customers to another (custom-built) Results Page. For a more customized experience, redirecting customers to a custom-built Results Page allows for greater flexibility in handling quiz data.

**What You Need**: Basic knowledge of JavaScript and handling JSON data.

1. **Set Up the Callback Function**: Implement the [callback function](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/use-callback-function/) on your website to capture quiz results in JSON format.
2. **Store and Redirect**: Configure the function to store the results locally (e.g., in the browser's local storage) before redirecting the user to your custom Results Page.
3. **Utilize the Data**: On your custom page, retrieve and use the quiz data as needed.

For a detailed guide on setting up the callback function, refer to [this resource](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/use-callback-function/).

## Add a Redirection Button to the Results Page

Offering a direct link to another page from your Results Page can be achieved simply with an HTML button.

**What You Need**: Ability to edit HTML content on your Results Page.

1. **Add an HTML Block**: In the [Results Page](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#results-page) editor, insert an `HTML block`.
2. **Insert the Button Code**: Use the following HTML snippet to add a button:

   ```html
   <a class="button" href="https://revenuehunt.com/">Visit RevenueHunt.com</a>
   ```

3. **Customize Appearance**: Style the button with CSS. You can add custom styles in the [Quiz Design](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#quiz-design) tab, targeting the button with `.lq-results a.button`.
