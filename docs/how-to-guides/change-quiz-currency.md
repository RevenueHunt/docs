## Multi-currency quizzes

At the moment the Shop Quiz: Product Recommendation Quiz doesn’t support multi-currency stores. We’re pulling your store’s **base currency**. Our app takes into account the original prices set up in your store. If your base currency is in USD dollars, then the US dollar prices will be the only ones synced with the app.

If you run a multi-currency shop there's a workaround. What most customers do is show the product on the results page without the price and instead choose the checkout option to view the product. This way the customer is redirected to the product page from the result where the right price is applied.

Follow these steps to apply this workaround:

1. Open the [Quiz Builder](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/).
2. Navigate to the [Results Page](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#results-page).
3. Open the [Results Page Settings](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#results-page-settings).
4. In [Basic Settings](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#basic-settings), check the `Checkout Settings` section. Select `Link to product`.
5. Scroll down to `Individual Product Settings`. 
5. Search for `Show price` and click the toggle to deactivate it. 

Now, the product price will not be shown and the customer will be redirected to the product page from the results page.
