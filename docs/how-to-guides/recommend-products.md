# How to Recommend Products

Our solution takes into account your customer's choices to offer highly personalized product recommendations. 

This guide explains how to recommend products with the RevenueHunt app, the underlying algorithm and proposes solutions for complex quizzes.

## Recommendations

=== "Shopify (Legacy)" 

    RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz can show on the results page **product variants**, **main products** and **[Recharge subscription products](/how-to-guides/recommend-subscription-products/)**. 

    RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz **cannot recommend collections** of products, though it's possible to [only recommend products from a specific collection](/how-to-guides/recommend-skincare-routine-slots/).

=== "Shopify" 

    RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz can show on the results page **product variants**, **main products** and **collections**.

    If you add a Block to your results page, you can choose to display **product variants**, **main products** or **collections** under [Block Settings > Recommendations Type](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#products-products-variants-collections). 

    - If you chose a **Products** under Recommendations Type, the Slot will show the main product with a optional dropdown to choose the specific variant. The order in which the product variants are displayed is based on the number of votes they received. If all varaints of the same product received the same number of votes, the variants will be displayed in random order.

    - If you chose a **Product Varaints** under Recommendations Type, the Slot will show recommended variants of a product with the full name of a product followed by the varaint name, for example "Toner - 100ml". 
    
        !!! note
        
            It is not possible to display the variants in a dropdown with this option, because it's meant to lead the user to the specific variant of a product. If you want to display the variants in a dropdown, you can use a **Products** option instead.

    - If you chose a **Collections** under Recommendations Type, the Slot will show the recommended a specific collection from your Shopify store. 

        !!! note

            If your recommended collections doesn't show any image, it's likely becuase you have not yet added an image to the collection in your Shopify > Products > Collections section. Once you add an image, the collection will show the image on the results page.


=== "WooCommerce" 

    RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz can show on the results page **simple products**, **variable products**, **grouped products**, **external/affiliate products** and **[WooCommerce subscription products](/how-to-guides/recommend-subscription-products/)**. 

    RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz **cannot recommend categories** of products, though it's possible to [only recommend products from a specific category/tag/attribute](/how-to-guides/recommend-skincare-routine-slots/).

    !!! warning
    
        Product Recommendation Quiz for WooCommerce can sync only one type of variants of variable products. For example, if a variable product has two types of variants, the first one being size, the second being color, the app will be able to only sync the size variant of your products.

=== "Magento" 

    RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz can show on the results page **product variants** and **main products**. 

    RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz **cannot recommend categories** of products, though it's possible to [only recommend products from a specific category](/how-to-guides/recommend-skincare-routine-slots/).

=== "BigCommerce"

=== "Standalone"

    RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz **cannot recommend collections** of products, though it's possible to [only recommend products from a specific collection](/how-to-guides/recommend-skincare-routine-slots/).


## Recommending the Right Products

=== "Shopify (Legacy)"

    Follow these steps to set up product recommendations in your Product Recommendation Quiz:

    1. **Link Products to Choices**: Navigate to the [Link Products/Collections/Upvote](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) tab within your quiz setup. For each choice, link/upvote relevant products. 
        - You can link./upvote product variants, collections, tags, variant collections, vendor collections or all variants of the same product at once.
    2. **Edit the Results Page**: In the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) tab you can edit the content of your results screen. You can add a heading, content block, image block, HTML block, Product Block or a Product Slot block. 

        !!! tip

            Check [How to Edit the Results Page](/how-to-guides/edit-results-page/) for more information.

    3. **Add a Product Block**: Products can be displayed on the Results Page as a list via the `Product Block` or divided into slots via the `Product Slot Block`. For beginners, it's recommended to use a `Product Block` to show the recommendations.
        - **Product Block** displays the products sorted by the number of votes - the most voted products are shown first, and the least voted last. In [Product Block settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) you can **choose how many products you want to show** at the end of the quiz.
            ![how to recommend products product block](/images/how_to_recommend_products_product_block.png){width="500"}

        - **Product Slot Blocks** allow you to display the products in clear steps, for example as a skincare routine. Each Product Slot will recommend the most-voted product from a collection that's linked to it. *Check [How to Recommend a Skincare Routine with Slots](/how-to-guides/recommend-skincare-routine-slots/) for step-by-step instructions on how to set up Slot Blocks.* 
            ![how to recommend products slots block](/images/how_to_recommend_products_slots_block.png)

    4. **Test the Results**: After your products are linked and the results page is set up, you can test your quiz.
        - Click [`Publish/Save`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) on the top-right menu to update the preview/live quiz. 
        - Then, click [`Preview`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) to test the quiz you've created in a new window. 
        
            !!! note
            
                You can test the quiz as much as you like as long as you always open a new preview window. These test responses done as admin are automatically removed after 1 hour to not add to your usage quota.

    5. **Troubleshoot the Results**: Use the quiz's [built-in search tool](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#responses) in the `Responses` section to understand why specific products were recommended or missing from the recommendations. 

        !!! tip
            Check [How to Troubleshoot Quiz Results](/how-to-guides/troubleshoot-product-results/) for detailed instructions on how to use this tool.
            
    6. **Refine the Results**: If you want to make the results ultra-precise, you can also:
        - **Limit the recommendations**: You can choose to limit the recommendations to only show products that received X votes or more in the [Results Page settings](/how-to-guides/only-recommend-products-with-minimum-votes/).
        - **Use Exclusions**: You can use [Exclusions](#exclusion) to make sure that unwanted products are not shown (even if they were upvoted in another choice earlier).

    By linking product variants and collections to quiz choices, and understanding the inclusion/exclusion logic, you can use our algorithm to offer precise product recommendations.

=== "Shopify" 

    In the `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app, there are several ways to recommend products:

    **‚úçüèª Option 1: Recommend Most Voted Products**

    *Best for most quizzes.*

    ![how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_funnel](/images/how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_funnel.png){width="300"}

    - Link products or collections to each quiz choice.
    - On the results page, add a product block that displays the most voted items.
    - You can show multiple product slots to recommend a routine or bundle.

    !!! note

        Follow [this guide](/how-to-guides/set-up-funnel-quiz/) to learn how to set up this option.

    **üéØ Option 2: Use Scoring or Variables**

    *Best for personality-style quizzes.*

    ![how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_winningvariable](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_scoringquiz_varaiblequiz.png){width="300"}

    - Assign a score or custom variable to each choice in the quiz.
    - Set up result sections with fixed recommendations for each type of outcome.
    - Use display logic to show the right section based on the score or variable with the highest value.
    - **Example:** Show Section A if the top variable is "blue", Section B if it‚Äôs "red".

    !!! note   

        Follow [this guide](/how-to-guides/set-up-scoring-quiz/) to learn how to set up this option.

    **üß© Option 3: Use Complex Display Logic**

    *Best for advanced logic or detailed recommendation matrices.*

    ![how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_displaylogic](/images/how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_displaylogic.png){width="300"}

    - Create logic-based paths that lead users to different result pages.
    - Or use one results page with multiple sections and display logic for each.
    - Show/hide each section depending on the customer‚Äôs answers.

## Specific Setup Guides

### [Recommend Products Based on Numerical Inputs](/how-to-guides/recommend-products-based-on-numerical-inputs/)

With RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz, it is not possible to recommend products based on open-ended numerical questions like Number or Date. Instead, it's recommended to set up finite choices to be able to use the user responses to set up precise recommendations.

[This guide](/how-to-guides/recommend-products-based-on-numerical-inputs/) is designed to help merchants effectively use dropdown and multiple-choice questions to set up precise numerical recommendations.

### [Only Recommend Products with X Votes or More](/how-to-guides/only-recommend-products-with-minimum-votes/)

It is possible to limit the number of recommended products on the results page by only showing products that received X votes or more (a certain minimum number of votes). This allows you to filter the quiz recommendations and only show the real winners.
