## Sending Follow-up Emails via Klaviyo

It’s possible to send the product recommendation follow-up emails via Klaviyo, although this is not something that’s a one-click install. It should be built by someone with technical knowledge and experience in Klaviyo. 

Below you’ll find some basic instructions that can be forwarded to a developer.

!!! note

    Once the quiz is connected to Klaviyo (and the data is sent there), it’s out of our app’s scope, and any particular questions on how to set up the flows and how to build the email templates should be directed to Klaviyo.

=== "Shopify"

    5. **Create an Email Flow**: You’ll have to create a flow that is triggered when someone gets added to the segment we created in the previous step. This is the trickiest part, the emails you send have to be custom-built in Klaviyo.

        2. Choose to create from scratch and come up with a name.

    6. **Edit the Email**: In the next steps, you should edit the email template.

    3. **Connect Quiz to Klaviyo**: Follow the instructions in [this](#link-your-quiz-to-klaviyo) section to learn how to connect your quiz to Klaviyo correctly.
    4. **Create a Segment**: All quiz contacts can be grouped into a segment in Klaviyo. 

        1. To create a new segment in Klaviyo go to `Audience > List & Segements` and click `create a new Segment`.
        2. Name the segment and set up the definition.
        3. The `PERMALINK-{{quiz_id}}` property is unique for profiles coming from the quiz. If you don’t see the permalink property in the dropdown menu, you may need to take a test quiz and try again.
        4. Click `Create a segment`. Now all the contacts coming from the quiz will also be added to this specific segment.

    5. **Create an Email Flow**: You’ll have to create a flow that is triggered when someone gets added to the segment we created in the previous step. This is the trickiest part, the emails you send have to be custom-built in Klaviyo. 

        1. To create an email flow that includes only quiz takers open the `Flows` tab. 
        2. Choose to create from scratch and come up with a name.
        3. Next, you’ll be asked to set up a `flow trigger`.
        4. Choose a segment created in the previous step. This way whenever someone enters the segment they will trigger the email flow.
        5. Confirm with `DONE`.
        6. Grab the `EMAIL` action and drop it below the flow trigger.

    6. **Edit the Email**: In the next steps, you should edit the email template.

        7. Click on the `three dots` and edit the email.
        8. Edit the name/subject/email to your liking and select the `HTML email template`.
        9. From the `Connect >  Klaviyo` tab you can download a ready-to-use email template.

                If you would rather create your own email template, check [this section](#use-quiz-data-in-klaviyo-email-templates) for more details.

        10. Copy the code and go back to Klaviyo.
        11. Open the `HTML email template` and remove the existing code.
        12. Paste the new template code.
        13. You can then `preview` the email as one of your segment subscribers.
        14. Make sure to `Save` the changes and click `Done`.
        15. Return to your flow and turn your email `LIVE`.

    From that moment on, all the quiz takers, who leave their email, will be automatically added to your Kalviyo Segment and will be sent a follow-up email. 

    Remember to deactivate the [email Notifications](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/) from the Quiz Builder once the Klaviyo flow is set up.

!!! tip

    It is possible to add contacts to Klaviyo List but there may be a better way: instead of adding them to a general list you can create **dynamic segments** based on your customers’ responses to send them hyper-targeted campaigns. Highly segmented campaigns return more than 3X the revenue per recipient as unsegmented campaigns.
    With Klaviyo you can create segments to filter your leads and assign email flows to each segment. [Read more](#sending-follow-up-emails-via-klaviyo) about how to create and use segments on Klaviyo.


## Use Quiz Data In Klaviyo Email Templates

=== "Shopify"

    If you need to modify our Klaviyo email template to match your brand’s style guide, you’ll need a developer because email templates in Klaviyo are built using HTML, CSS and the [Django templating](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/templates/builtins/) system.

    We send all the responses to the quiz and the recommended products along with the contact information to the customer’s Klaviyo profile. This information will appear in the customer’s profile as `custom properties`.

    ![how to send leads to klaviyo customer profile](/images/how to send leads to klaviyo customer profile.png)

    If you need to add any additional information to the email template, your developer can do so by pulling the appropriate `custom properties` from the user profile.

    **Example Email Templates**

    In this example, we’re using our quiz ID `dbqHqN`, which you’ll need to replace for your quiz ID. Here is the code for reference:

        ```html
        <h3>Hello {{ person|lookup:'Q-dbqHqN ZMiXjj: .Before we get started... what\'s your name?'|default:'' }}!</h3>
        <p>Here we are making sure the product exists:</p>
        {% if person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_image_url' %}
        <p>Cleanser</p>
        <p><img alt="This is the cleanser image" src="{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_image_url'|default:'' }}" /></p>
        <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_name'|default:'' }}</p>
        <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_price'|default:'' }}</p>
        <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_sku'|default:'' }}</p>
        <p><a href="{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_url'|default:'' }}">Buy now</a></p>
        {% endif %}
        {% if person|lookup:'T-dbqHqN: 40s' %}
        <p>You are in your forties</p>
        {% endif %}
        ```

    This example demonstrated that you can not only include custom properties that are passed from the quiz to your Klaviyo account, but you can also use `IF-ELSE` conditional statements to show/hide content based on the customer’s responses to the quiz.

    !!! note

        Note that when looping through the products, the **count starts in 0 (zero)**, so for example, if you were to display the name of 3 products in a slot you’d have to do it like this:

            ```html
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_0_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_1_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_2_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            ```

    Here are some other email templates that you can use as a reference:

    !!! warning

        Bear in mind that these templates (unlike the one generated from the Connect > Klaviyo tab) won’t work as is. They were created for a sample quiz. Your developer will have to modify the `custom properties` to match the ones that are passed from the quiz to your Klaviyo account. The `quiz ID` is different, so are other property names.

        <p><a href="{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_url'|default:'' }}">Buy now</a></p>
        {% endif %}
        {% if person|lookup:'T-dbqHqN: 40s' %}
        <p>You are in your forties</p>
        {% endif %}
        ```

    This example demonstrated that you can not only include custom properties that are passed from the quiz to your Klaviyo account, but you can also use `IF-ELSE` conditional statements to show/hide content based on the customer’s responses to the quiz.

    !!! note

        Note that when looping through the products, the **count starts in 0 (zero)**, so for example, if you were to display the name of 3 products in a slot you’d have to do it like this:

            ```html
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_0_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_1_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_2_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            ```

    !!! warning

        Bear in mind that these templates (unlike the one generated from the Connect > Klaviyo tab) won’t work as is. They were created for a sample quiz. Your developer will have to modify the `custom properties` to match the ones that are passed from the quiz to your Klaviyo account. The `quiz ID` is different, so are other property names.

=== "Magento"

    If you need to modify our Klaviyo email template to match your brand’s style guide, you’ll need a developer because email templates in Klaviyo are built using HTML, CSS and the [Django templating](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/templates/builtins/) system.

    We send all the responses to the quiz and the recommended products along with the contact information to the customer’s Klaviyo profile. This information will appear in the customer’s profile as `custom properties`.

    ![how to send leads to klaviyo customer profile](/images/how to send leads to klaviyo customer profile.png)

    If you need to add any additional information to the email template, your developer can do so by pulling the appropriate `custom properties` from the user profile.

    **Example Email Templates**

    In this example, we’re using our quiz ID `dbqHqN`, which you’ll need to replace for your quiz ID. Here is the code for reference:

        ```html
        <h3>Hello {{ person|lookup:'Q-dbqHqN ZMiXjj: .Before we get started... what\'s your name?'|default:'' }}!</h3>
        <p>Here we are making sure the product exists:</p>
        {% if person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_image_url' %}
        <p>Cleanser</p>
        <p><img alt="This is the cleanser image" src="{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_image_url'|default:'' }}" /></p>
        <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_name'|default:'' }}</p>
        <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_price'|default:'' }}</p>
        <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_sku'|default:'' }}</p>
        <p><a href="{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_url'|default:'' }}">Buy now</a></p>
        {% endif %}

### Pull Product Information Directly from Shopify

There’s a feature in Klaviyo that allows you to pull the product information directly from Shopify by providing the id. This way you don’t need to use the `description` or `image_url` that is provided by revenuehunt, but can pull it directly from Shopify by providing the origin_id of the product. More information about this function can be found [here](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004785571-Overview-of-the-Catalog-Lookup-Tag).
