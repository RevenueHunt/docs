        2. Choose to create from scratch and come up with a name.
        3. Next, you’ll be asked to set up a `flow trigger`.
        4. Choose a segment created in the previous step. This way whenever someone enters the segment they will trigger the email flow.
        5. Confirm with `DONE`.
        6. Grab the `EMAIL` action and drop it below the flow trigger.

    6. **Edit the Email**: In the next steps, you should edit the email template.

        7. Click on the `three dots` and edit the email.
        8. Edit the name/subject/email to your liking and select the `HTML email template`.
        9. From the `Connect >  Klaviyo` tab you can download a ready-to-use email template.

        10. Copy the code and go back to Klaviyo.
        11. Open the `HTML email template` and remove the existing code.
        12. Paste the new template code.
        13. You can then `preview` the email as one of your segment subscribers.
        14. Make sure to `Save` the changes and click `Done`.
        15. Return to your flow and turn your email `LIVE`.

    From that moment on, all the quiz takers, who leave their email, will be automatically added to your Kalviyo Segment and will be sent a follow-up email.

!!! tip

    It is possible to add contacts to Klaviyo List but there may be a better way: instead of adding them to a general list you can create **dynamic segments** based on your customers’ responses to send them hyper-targeted campaigns. Highly segmented campaigns return more than 3X the revenue per recipient as unsegmented campaigns.
    With Klaviyo you can create segments to filter your leads and assign email flows to each segment. [Read more](#sending-follow-up-emails-via-klaviyo) about how to create and use segments on Klaviyo.

## Use Quiz Data In Klaviyo Email Templates

=== "Shopify"

    If you need to modify our Klaviyo email template to match your brand’s style guide, you’ll need a developer because email templates in Klaviyo are built using HTML, CSS and the [Django templating](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/templates/builtins/) system.

    We send all the responses to the quiz and the recommended products along with the contact information to the customer’s Klaviyo profile. This information will appear in the customer’s profile as `custom properties`.

    ![how to send leads to klaviyo customer profile](/images/how_to_send_leads_to_klaviyo_customer_profile.png)

    If you need to add any additional information to the email template, your developer can do so by pulling the appropriate `custom properties` from the user profile.

    !!! note

        To build your own email template based on the custom properties we send to Klaviyo, you should familiarize yourself with the [message personalization reference](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408802648731) in Klaviyo, aka the `{{ person|lookup:"..." }}` function.

### Example Email Templates

=== "Shopify"

    In this example, we’re using our quiz ID `dbqHqN`, which you’ll need to replace for your quiz ID. Here is the code for reference:

        ```html
        <h3>Hello {{ person|lookup:'Q-dbqHqN ZMiXjj: .Before we get started... what\'s your name?'|default:'' }}!</h3>
        <p>Here we are making sure the product exists:</p>
        {% if person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_image_url' %}
        <p>Cleanser</p>
        <p><img alt="This is the cleanser image" src="{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_image_url'|default:'' }}" /></p>
        <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_name'|default:'' }}</p>
        <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_price'|default:'' }}</p>
        <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_sku'|default:'' }}</p>
        <p><a href="{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_url'|default:'' }}">Buy now</a></p>
        {% endif %}
        {% if person|lookup:'T-dbqHqN: 40s' %}
        <p>You are in your forties</p>
        {% endif %}
        ```

    This example demonstrated that you can not only include custom properties that are passed from the quiz to your Klaviyo account, but you can also use `IF-ELSE` conditional statements to show/hide content based on the customer’s responses to the quiz.

    !!! note

        Note that when looping through the products, the **count starts in 0 (zero)**, so for example, if you were to display the name of 3 products in a slot you’d have to do it like this:

            ```html
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_0_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_1_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_2_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            ```

    Here are some other email templates that you can use as a reference:

    !!! warning

        Bear in mind that these templates (unlike the one generated from the Connect > Klaviyo tab) won’t work as is. They were created for a sample quiz. Your developer will have to modify the `custom properties` to match the ones that are passed from the quiz to your Klaviyo account. The `quiz ID` is different, so are other property names.

    **EXAMPLE 1 - DISPLAY RECOMMENDED PRODUCTS**

    In this example, a quiz with ID `YN5L9G` recommends a simple list of products.

    ![how_to_shipifyv2_klaviyo_template_productlist1](/images/how_to_shipifyv2_klaviyo_template_productlist1.png){width="300"}


    To show the recommended products in the email, you can use the following code copied from the Klaviyo template in the [`Integrations`](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab:

    ```
    If you paste this code into an HTML block in a Klaviyo template and preview the email as one of the quiz subscribers, you will see the recommended products.

    ![how_to_shipifyv2_klaviyo_template_productlist2](/images/how_to_shipifyv2_klaviyo_template_productlist2.png)

    To style the recommended products, your developer will need to add CSS classes to the HTML code and style it the way you want. For example, this is a styled version of the code above:

    ```html
    <!-- Two-Column Product Grid for Klaviyo Email -->

    ![how_to_shipifyv2_klaviyo_template_productlist3](/images/how_to_shipifyv2_klaviyo_template_productlist3.png)

    !!! tip

        You can feed the template code to a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT or Gemini to generate a styled version of the code.

    You can use elements of the code in your Klaviyo template elements. For example, you can use the `{{ person|lookup:'RECOMMENDATIONS_BY_SLOT-YN5L9G'|lookup:'rsbss-ca4fba94'|lookup:'0'|lookup:'title' }}` to display the title of the first product in a text block.

    ![how_to_shipifyv2_klaviyo_template_productlist4](/images/how_to_shipifyv2_klaviyo_template_productlist4.png)

    !!! note

        In this example, here's a product object structure that was sent to Klaviyo:

        - Display recommendation of **item 0** for **slot rsbss-ca4fba94**
        - Title: `{{ person|lookup:'RECOMMENDATIONS_BY_SLOT-YN5L9G'|lookup:'rsbss-ca4fba94'|lookup:'0'|lookup:'title' }}`
        - Description: `{{ person|lookup:'RECOMMENDATIONS_BY_SLOT-YN5L9G'|lookup:'rsbss-ca4fba94'|lookup:'0'|lookup:'description' }}`	
        - Price: `{{ person|lookup:'RECOMMENDATIONS_BY_SLOT-YN5L9G'|lookup:'rsbss-ca4fba94'|lookup:'0'|lookup:'price'|lookup:'amount' }} {{ person|lookup:'RECOMMENDATIONS_BY_SLOT-YN5L9G'|lookup:'rsbss-ca4fba94'|lookup:'0'|lookup:'price'|lookup:'currencyCode' }}`

        {% if person|lookup:'T-dbqHqN: 40s' %}
        <p>You are in your forties</p>
        {% endif %}
        ```

    This example demonstrated that you can not only include custom properties that are passed from the quiz to your Klaviyo account, but you can also use `IF-ELSE` conditional statements to show/hide content based on the customer’s responses to the quiz.

    !!! note

        Note that when looping through the products, the **count starts in 0 (zero)**, so for example, if you were to display the name of 3 products in a slot you’d have to do it like this:

            ```html
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_0_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_1_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_2_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            ```

    !!! warning

        Bear in mind that these templates (unlike the one generated from the Connect > Klaviyo tab) won’t work as is. They were created for a sample quiz. Your developer will have to modify the `custom properties` to match the ones that are passed from the quiz to your Klaviyo account. The `quiz ID` is different, so are other property names.

=== "Magento"

    In this example, we’re using our quiz ID `dbqHqN`, which you’ll need to replace for your quiz ID. Here is the code for reference:

        ```html
        <h3>Hello {{ person|lookup:'Q-dbqHqN ZMiXjj: .Before we get started... what\'s your name?'|default:'' }}!</h3>
        <p>Here we are making sure the product exists:</p>
        {% if person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_image_url' %}
        <p>Cleanser</p>
        <p><img alt="This is the cleanser image" src="{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_image_url'|default:'' }}" /></p>
        <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_name'|default:'' }}</p>
        <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_price'|default:'' }}</p>
        <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_sku'|default:'' }}</p>
        <p><a href="{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_url'|default:'' }}">Buy now</a></p>
        {% endif %}

### Pull Product Information Directly from Shopify

There’s a feature in Klaviyo that allows you to pull the product information directly from Shopify by providing the id. This way you don’t need to use the `description` or `image_url` that is provided by revenuehunt, but can pull it directly from Shopify by providing the origin_id of the product. More information about this function can be found [here](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004785571-Overview-of-the-Catalog-Lookup-Tag).
