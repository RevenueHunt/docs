??? warning "Klaviyo Limitations"

    **Processing Time**: Klaviyo may have some delay in displaying new leads.

    **Character Limitations**: Special characters (e.g., è, é, ê) may impede data transmission.

## Sending Follow-up Emails via Klaviyo

It’s possible to send the product recommendation follow-up emails via Klaviyo, although this is not something that’s a one-click install. It should be built by someone with technical knowledge and experience in Klaviyo. 

Below you’ll find some basic instructions that can be forwarded to a developer.

??? warning "RevenueHunt Support Scope"

    Once the quiz is connected to Klaviyo (and the data is sent there), it’s out of our app’s scope, and any particular questions on how to set up the flows and how to build the email templates should be directed to Klaviyo.

=== "Shopify"

    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ccqOIhfskw?si=Jq3axq2iupfy2Xxu&amp;start=114" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

    1. **Add Email Question**: To send contacts to Klaviyo your quiz needs to have an email question. You can add it to the quiz from the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) tab by clicking `+` and selecting `email` from the dropdown list.

        !!! tip

            You can [ask for marketing consent](/how-to-guides/ask-for-marketing-consent/) directly in the quiz.
    2. **Connect Quiz to Klaviyo**: Follow the instructions in [this section](#link-your-quiz-to-klaviyo) to learn how to connect your quiz to Klaviyo correctly.
    3. **Create a Segment**: All quiz contacts can be grouped into a segment in Klaviyo. 

        1. To create a new segment in Klaviyo go to  `Audience > List & Segements` and click `Create New > New Segment`.
        2. Name the segment and set up the definition. 
        3. Segment definition: Select `Properties about someone` and add a property that will be unique for profiles coming from the quiz. This can be any of the [custom properties](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/#use-quiz-data-in-klaviyo-email-templates) that RevenueHunt sends to Klaviyo Profiles.
            
            !!! example "Example"
            
                - `ANSWERS_BY_BLOCK-QuizID` property is unique for profiles coming from the quiz.  

                - If you don't see the `ANSWERS_BY_BLOCK-QuizID` property in the dropdown menu, you may need to take a test quiz and try again.

        4. Segment definition: As segment definition set up a rule that follows this format: `Custom property from the Quiz` `is set` Type: `text`.

            !!! example "Example"

                - `ANSWERS_BY_BLOCK-QuizID` `is set` Type: `text`.

        5. Click `Create a segment` and wait for Klaviyo to load all the contacts that match the segment definition. This may take a few minutes.
        6. Once the agent finishes loading, all the profiles that already match the segment definition will be added to the segment. New contacts coming from the quiz will be added to the segment automatically.

    4. **Create an Email Flow**: You’ll have to create a flow that is triggered when someone gets added to the segment we created in the previous step. This is the trickiest part, the emails you send have to be custom-built in Klaviyo. 

        **Trigger the Flow**

        1. To create an email flow that includes only quiz takers open the `Flows` tab in Klaviyo. 
        2. Click `Create flow` and then `Build from scratch`.
        3. Name the flow and click `Create flow`.
        4. Next, you'll be asked to set up a flow trigger.
        5. Choose the trigger to be `Added to a segment` and select the segment created in the [previous step](/tutorials/follow-up-emails-klaviyo/#create-segment-for-quiz-takers). Click `Confirm` and `Confirm and save`. This way whenever someone enters the segment they will trigger the email flow.    

        **Optional: Update Marketing Consent**

        If you've [asked for marketing consent in the quiz](/how-to-guides/ask-for-marketing-consent/), you can update it in the Klaviyo email flow. Just follw these steps:

        1. Right below the flow trigger, add a `Profile property update` action.
        2. Click `+ Step`.
        3. A menu will appear letting up set up the profile property update.
        4. Select to `Update existing property`, from the Select property dropdown menu select `Accepts marketing` and set the value to `true`.
        5. Turn this action `LIVE`.

    6. **Edit the Email**: In the next steps, you should edit the email template.

        **Add Email Action**

        7. In the `Quiz Settings > Integrations` section, you'll find a button to download a `Klaviyo Template`. Click the `Klaviyo Template` button and a new window will open. There, click `Copy code` to copy the existing template.

    8. **Re-trigger the flow**: If you want to send an email with each quiz retake, you can do that by adding a `Profile property update` action at the end of the flow. Follow these steps:

        1. Add a `Profile property update` action at the end of the flow.
        2. Click `+ Step`.
        3. Select `Delete existing property`.
        4. From the `Select property` dropdown menu select the property that was used to create a segment in earlier steps.

            ??? info "How to send an email every time someone completes the quiz?"

                First, you need to set up a segment based on (for example) the `ANSWERS_BY_BLOCK-{{quiz_id}}` property to filter quiz takers. Once the segment is created, you can build a flow that triggers when users are added to this segment, sends them their quiz results via email, and then **removes the `ANSWERS_BY_BLOCK-{{quiz_id}}` property from their profile** to allow for re-entry if they retake the quiz.

                For example:

        5. Save the changes and turn the action `LIVE`.

        This way, each time a quiz taker takes the quiz again, they will be re-added to the segment and will trigger the email flow again.

        From that moment on, all the quiz takers, who leave their email, will be automatically added to your Kalviyo Segment and will be sent a follow-up email. 

    7. **Re-trigger the flow**: If you want to send an email with each quiz retake, you can do that by adding a `Profile property update` action at the end of the flow. Follow these steps:

        1. Add a `Profile property update` action at the end of the flow.
        2. Click `+ Step`.
        3. Select `Delete existing property`.
        4. From the `Select property` dropdown menu select the property that was used to create a segment in earlier steps. 

            !!! example "Example"

                Select `Delete existing property` > `PERMALINK-QuizID`.

                First, you need to set up a segment based on the `PERMALINK-{{quiz_id}}` property to filter quiz takers. Once the segment is created, you can build a flow that triggers when users are added to this segment, sends them their quiz results via email, and then **removes the `PERMALINK-{{quiz_id}}` property from their profile** to allow for re-entry if they retake the quiz.

                For example:

        5. Save the changes and turn the action `LIVE`.

        This way, each time a quiz taker takes the quiz again, they will be re-added to the segment and will trigger the email flow again.

    1. **Add Email Question**: To send contacts to Klaviyo your quiz needs to have an email question. You can add it to the quiz from the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) tab by clicking `+` and selecting `email` from the dropdown list. You can also [ask for marketing consent](/how-to-guides/ask-for-marketing-consent/) directly in the quiz.
    2. **Connect Quiz to Klaviyo**: Follow the instructions in [this](#link-your-quiz-to-klaviyo) section to learn how to connect your quiz to Klaviyo correctly.
    3. **Create a Segment**: All quiz contacts can be grouped into a segment in Klaviyo. 

        1. To create a new segment in Klaviyo go to  `Audience > List & Segements` and click `Create New > New Segment`.
        2. Name the segment and set up the definition.
        3. The `Permalink-QuizID`  property is unique for profiles coming from the quiz.
        4. If you don't see the permalink property in the dropdown menu, you may need to take a test quiz and try again.
        5. Click `Create a segment`.

    5. **Create an Email Flow**: You’ll have to create a flow that is triggered when someone gets added to the segment we created in the previous step. This is the trickiest part, the emails you send have to be custom-built in Klaviyo. 

        **Trigger Flow**

        1. To create an email flow that includes only quiz takers open the `Flows` tab in Klaviyo. 
        2. Click `Create flow` and then `Build from scratch`.
        3. Name the flow and click `Create flow`.
        4. Next, you'll be asked to set up a flow trigger.
        5. Choose the trigger to be `Added to a segment` and select the segment created in the [previous step](/tutorials/follow-up-emails-klaviyo/#create-segment-for-quiz-takers). Click `Confirm` and `Confirm and save`. This way whenever someone enters the segment they will trigger the email flow.    

        **Optional: Update Marketing Consent**

        If you've [asked for marketing consent in the quiz](/how-to-guides/ask-for-marketing-consent/), you can update it in the Klaviyo email flow. Just follw these steps:

        1. Right below the flow trigger, add a `Profile property update` action.
        2. Click `+ Step`.
        3. A menu will appear letting up set up the profile property update.
        4. Select to `Update existing property`, from the Select property dropdown menu select `Accepts marketing` and set the value to `true`.
        5. Turn this action `LIVE`.



    6. **Edit the Email**: In the next steps, you should edit the email template.

        **Add Email Action**

        7. Click on the `three dots` and edit the email.
        8. Edit the name/subject/email to your liking and select the `HTML email template`.
        9. From the `Connect >  Klaviyo` tab you can download a ready-to-use email template.

??? tip "Tip: Segmented Campaigns Work Better"

    It is possible to add contacts to Klaviyo List but there may be a better way: instead of adding them to a general list you can create **dynamic segments** based on your customers’ responses to send them hyper-targeted campaigns. Highly segmented campaigns return more than 3X the revenue per recipient as unsegmented campaigns.

    With Klaviyo you can create segments to filter your leads and assign email flows to each segment. [Read more](#sending-follow-up-emails-via-klaviyo) about how to create and use segments on Klaviyo.

## Use Quiz Data In Klaviyo Email Templates

    If you need to modify our Klaviyo email template to match your brand’s style guide, you’ll need a developer because email templates in Klaviyo are built using HTML, CSS and the [Django templating](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/templates/builtins/) system.

    **Custom Properties in Klaviyo**

    We send all the responses to the quiz and the recommended products along with the contact information to the customer’s Klaviyo profile. This information will appear in the customer’s profile as `custom properties`.

    ![how to send leads to klaviyo customer profile](/images/how_to_klaviyo_shopify_v2_customer_profile.png)

    If you need to add any additional information to the email template, your developer can do so by pulling the appropriate `custom properties` from the user profile.

    ??? info "Learn the person|lookup function"

        To build your own email template based on the custom properties we send to Klaviyo, you should familiarize yourself with the [message personalization reference](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408802648731) in Klaviyo, aka the `{{ person|lookup:"..." }}` function.

    ??? warning "Overwriting or Appending Custom Properties"	

        Some custom properties sent to Klaviyo from the quiz such as `ANSWER_BY_BLOCK`, `CHOICE`, `RESPONSE_ID`, `RESULT_REF`, `RESULT_SECTIONS` or `TAGS` are sent as an array, meaning that their values get **overwritten** with new data upon each quiz completion.

        However, properties such as `RECOMMENDATIONS_BY_SLOT` or `RESULT_CONTENT_BY_BLOCK` are sent as a JSON object, meaning that their values get **appended** to the existing data upon each quiz completion. 

        If you want to make sure that in your Klaviyo template, the **values get overwritten** with new data upon each quiz completion and you want to use our pre-defined Klaviyo email tempalte which you can download from [Integrations](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab, make sure to only use the code snippet that starts with the following comment:
        
        
        ```html
        {# ================================================================= #}
        {# DYNAMIC RESULT PAGE CONTENT (LOOPS THROUGH RESULT_SECTIONS-lBJ9bk) #}
        {# This template loops through the result sections and blocks          #}
        {# It will adapt if you change the results page structure in the quiz editor #}

    3. To style the recommended products, your developer will need to add CSS classes to the HTML code and style it the way you want. 
    
        For example, this is a styled version of the code above:

        ??? example "Example: Styled version of the code above"

        ??? tip "Tip: Use Copilot or AI to style the code"

            You can use [Quiz Copilot](/how-to-guides/use-quiz-copilot/) or another AI agent like ChatGPT or Gemini to generate a styled version of the code.

    4. You can use elements of the code in your Klaviyo template elements. 


        !!! example "Example: Display Product Title in Text Block"
        
        
            For example, you can use the `{{ person|lookup:'RECOMMENDATIONS_BY_SLOT-YN5L9G'|lookup:'rsbss-ca4fba94'|lookup:'0'|lookup:'title' }}` to display the title of the first product in a text block.

    ### Example 2 - Display Quiz Answers


    A Skincare Quiz with ID `YN5L9G` wants to display all customer answers in the email. 
    
    1. To do this, you can use the following code copied from the Klaviyo template in the [`Integrations`](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab:

    
        ![how_to_klaviyo_shopify_v2_get_template](/images/how_to_klaviyo_shopify_v2_get_template.png)


        ??? example "Example: Code from Quiz Integrations tab"

            <br>
            </p>
            ```
        
    2. When this code is copied into an HTML block in a Klaviyo template and previewd as one of the quiz subscribes is will display a full list of all the answers.

        ![how_to_shipifyv2_klaviyo_template_answerslist1](/images/how_to_shipifyv2_klaviyo_template_answerslist1.png)

    3. If you want to show specific answers in your email template, you can copy parts of the code. 
    
        !!! example "Example: Display Answer for Q3: AGE GROUP"

            For example, you can use `{{ person|lookup:'ANSWER_BY_BLOCK-qbc-dd744cf3-YN5L9G' }}` to  display answer for Q3: AGE GROUP (ref qbc-dd744cf3).

            Here's how to use it in a Klaviyo template text block:

            ![how_to_shipifyv2_klaviyo_template_answerslist2](/images/how_to_shipifyv2_klaviyo_template_answerslist2.png)

        !!! info "Sample Answer Object Structure"

            In this example, here's how to get answers for a specific question:

            Quiz name: `{{ person|lookup:'QUIZ_NAME-YN5L9G' }}`

            First name: `{{ person.first_name }}`

            Last name: `{{ person.last_name }}`

            Q2: BEFORE WE BEGIN: `{{ person|lookup:'ANSWER_BY_BLOCK-qbi-6c4248f5-YN5L9G' }}`

            Q3: AGE GROUP: `{{ person|lookup:'ANSWER_BY_BLOCK-qbc-dd744cf3-YN5L9G' }}`

            Q4: SKIN TYPE: `{{ person|lookup:'ANSWER_BY_BLOCK-qbc-485600ce-YN5L9G' }}`

            Q9: SKIN CONCERNS: `{{ person|lookup:'ANSWER_BY_BLOCK-qbc-e8cf3180-YN5L9G' }}`

            Q10: ALERGIES: `{{ person|lookup:'ANSWER_BY_BLOCK-qbc-329aaeff-YN5L9G' }}`

            Q11: WE'VE GOT YOUR RESULTS - #1 [email]: `{{ person|lookup:'ANSWER_BY_BLOCK-qbi-29f016cf-YN5L9G' }}`
            
            Q11: WE'VE GOT YOUR RESULTS - #2 [multiple_choice]: `{{ person|lookup:'ANSWER_BY_BLOCK-qbc-cb601cf6-YN5L9G' }}`

    ### Example 3 - Display Link to Quiz Results

    Use the `RESPONSE_ID-QuizID` to create a link to the quiz results page. 
    
    1. Just add `#response-{{ person|lookup:'RESPONSE_ID-QuizID' }}` to the end of your results page href attribute in any link or URL. 

        !!! example "Example: Link to Quiz Results"

            `<a href="https://yourwebsite.com/#response-{{ person|lookup:'RESPONSE_ID-Gli0KD' }}">View your quiz results</a>`

            where `Gli0KD` is the quiz ID and

            - `{{ person|lookup:'RESPONSE_ID-Gli0KD' }}` fetches the dynamic response ID (e.g., eVgV0Y).




=== "Shopify (Legacy)"

    In this example, we’re using our quiz ID `dbqHqN`, which you’ll need to replace for your quiz ID. Here is the code for reference:

    ??? example "Example: Basic Slots Template"

        ```html
        <h3>Hello {{ person|lookup:'Q-dbqHqN ZMiXjj: .Before we get started... what\'s your name?'|default:'' }}!</h3>
        <p>Here we are making sure the product exists:</p>
        {% if person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_image_url' %}
        <p>Cleanser</p>
        <p><img alt="This is the cleanser image" src="{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_image_url'|default:'' }}" /></p>
        <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_name'|default:'' }}</p>
        <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_price'|default:'' }}</p>
        <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_sku'|default:'' }}</p>
        <p><a href="{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN: Step 1: Cleanser - product_0_url'|default:'' }}">Buy now</a></p>
        {% endif %}
        {% if person|lookup:'T-dbqHqN: 40s' %}
        <p>You are in your forties</p>
        {% endif %}
        ```

    This example demonstrated that you can not only include custom properties that are passed from the quiz to your Klaviyo account, but you can also use `IF-ELSE` conditional statements to show/hide content based on the customer’s responses to the quiz.

    !!! note "Note: Counting Products"

        Note that when looping through the products, the **count starts in 0 (zero)**, so for example, if you were to display the name of 3 products in a slot you’d have to do it like this:

            ```html
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_0_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_1_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_2_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            ```

    !!! warning "Note: These templates won’t work as is"

        Bear in mind that these templates (unlike the one generated from the Connect > Klaviyo tab) won’t work as is. They were created for a sample quiz. Your developer will have to modify the `custom properties` to match the ones that are passed from the quiz to your Klaviyo account. The `quiz ID` is different, so are other property names.

    This example demonstrated that you can not only include custom properties that are passed from the quiz to your Klaviyo account, but you can also use `IF-ELSE` conditional statements to show/hide content based on the customer’s responses to the quiz.

    !!! note "Note: Counting Products"

        Note that when looping through the products, the **count starts in 0 (zero)**, so for example, if you were to display the name of 3 products in a slot you’d have to do it like this:

            ```html
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_0_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_1_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            <p>{{ person|lookup:'SLOT-dbqHqN - product_2_name'|default:'' }}</p>
            ```

    !!! warning "Note: These templates won’t work as is"

        Bear in mind that these templates (unlike the one generated from the Connect > Klaviyo tab) won’t work as is. They were created for a sample quiz. Your developer will have to modify the `custom properties` to match the ones that are passed from the quiz to your Klaviyo account. The `quiz ID` is different, so are other property names.

### Pull Product Information Directly from Shopify

There’s a feature in Klaviyo that allows you to pull the product information directly from Shopify by providing the id. This way you don’t need to use the `description` or `image_url` that is provided by revenuehunt, but can pull it directly from Shopify by providing the origin_id of the product. More information about this function can be found [here](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004785571-Overview-of-the-Catalog-Lookup-Tag).
