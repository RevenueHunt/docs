# How to Show a Quiz Based on Shopify Markets

This article explains how to show a quiz based on Shopify Markets.

With RevenueHunt Quizzes app, you can show a different quiz to users from different markets and languages.

## Step 1: Configure Shopify Markets

To start, make sure you have [Shopify Markets](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/international/managing) enabled and cofigured in your Shopify store. In order to show a quiz in a differnt currency or language, you first need to have a market configured in your Shopify store for these currencies or languages.

!!! example "Example"
    If you have a market configured for Europe with the `EUR` currency, you can show a quiz in that market. If you have a market configured for the US with the `USD` currency, you can show a quiz in that market.


## Step 2: Create Different Quizzes for Different Markets

 Go to the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and create a new quiz. 
 
 To create a quiz in a different languege, duplicate the quiz from the dashbaord and edit the quiz.

 The quiz doesn't have an automatic translstaion option, so you will have to transalte all the questions and answers manually. The text of buttons and admin messages can be translated in the [Quiz Settings > Quiz Content](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#messages-quiz-content) section.

 You can create as many quizzes as you want, each in a different language.

## Step 3: Configure In-App Shopify Markets

Once all your quizzes in different languages are created, head over to [App Settings > Shopify Markets](/reference/app-settings/#shopify-markets). This section contains all the markets and langueges you've set up in your Shopify store.

Select which quiz should be the default quiz shown for each market.

Click on `Show ALL locales` to set up a different default quiz for each languge and market specifically.

In there, you can also change format of how the price currency on recommended product is displayed. If you don't change the default, the price will be displayed as set up in your Shopify Market. If you want to change the format type the currency in the format you want, for example `${{amount}}` or `{{amount}}â‚¬` can be used to replace the default `{{amount}}USD` or `{{amount}}EUR`.

## Step 4: Save the Changes

Save the changes. From now on, the default quiz for your store will open. If you've configured [Shopify Markets](/reference/app-settings/#shopify-markets), the default quiz for that specific market will be shown instead.

## Step 5: Test the Quiz

To test that the right quiz is shown for the right market, ensure that the quiz is published on your website by following the instructions in the [Publish](/reference/quiz-builder/share-publish/) tab of the app or [this how to article](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/publish-quiz/).

Then navigate to your website and change the languge or region to see if the right quiz is shown for that market.

!!! warning

    The `Preview` option in the quiz builder always displays the default quiz in the default main market. It is not yet possible to preview the quiz in a different market within the app. To test the quiz in a different market, you need to publish the quiz on your website and then change the languge or region to see if the right quiz is shown for that market.
