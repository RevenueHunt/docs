    To start, make sure you have [Shopify Markets](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/international/managing) enabled and cofigured in your Shopify store. In order to show a quiz in a differnt currency or language, you first need to have a market configured in your Shopify store for these currencies or languages.

        If you have a market configured for Europe with the `EUR` currency, you can show a quiz in that market. 
        
        If you have a market configured for the US with the `USD` currency, you can show a quiz in that market.

        If you have a market in Spanish with the `ES` language, you can show a quiz in Spanish for that market.

        If you market in France with the `FR` language, you can show a quiz in French for that market.
