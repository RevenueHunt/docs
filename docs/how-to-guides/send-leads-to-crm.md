# How to Send Quiz Leads to Your CRM

Apart from giving your customers personalized product recommendations, you can connect your quiz to a CRM service like Klaviyo or MailChimp. This way all the contacts coming from the quiz will be added to your CRM account and you can create targeted email campaigns to upsell them.

## Direct Integrations

### [:fontawesome-brands-shopify: Shopify Customers](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-shopify-customers/)

You can add new customers automatically to your Shopify Customers list every time someone completes the quiz. Once someone leaves their email in the quiz, their Shopify Customer profile will be updated with their name, email, phone number and [customer tags](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/#customer-tags).

### [:fontawesome-brands-mailchimp: MailChimp](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-mailchimp/)

Automating the transfer of quiz data to your Mailchimp account streamlines the process of segmenting your audience and enables targeted follow-up campaigns based on [customer tags](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/#customer-tags). Mailchimp integration only supports email, name, and customer tags to be send from the quiz. For more complex emailing/data needs, including direct product recommendations, consider using a different service.

## Indirect Integrations

If we don't currently integrate with your CRM service and you want to send data there automatically you could set up a redirection via one of our current integrations such as [Zapier](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-zapier/) or [Webhooks](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-webhooks/).

Alternatively, you can also [send result emails directly from the app](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/) or [download all responses as a CSV file](/how-to-guides/download-quiz-responses/) and upload them manually your thrid-party service.
