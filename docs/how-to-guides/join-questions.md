# How to Display Multiple Questions per Slide in Your Quiz

This guide will walk you through the process of combining questions into a single slide using the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/).

The ability to display multiple questions on a single slide can help reduce the overall length of your quiz and keep participants engaged. 

To combine two or more questions into one slide, follow these steps:

=== "Shopify"

    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/d07fc75cb3474e0ebf8e7f1736c8e024?sid=c26b47b1-709d-4833-a256-4d9c2e35a0f3" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

    1. Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/).
    2. Add a question to the quiz by clicking on the [`+ question`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-types) button.
    3. Within the question, click [`+ block`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) and select a block type from the list. 
    4. To show an extra question on the same slide, click [`+ block`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) and select a differnt block type from the list. 
    5. Both questions will now appear on the same slide.
