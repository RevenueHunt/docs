# How to Display Multiple Questions per Slide in Your Quiz

This guide will walk you through the process of combining questions into a single slide using the [Quiz Builder](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/).

The ability to display multiple questions on a single slide can help reduce the overall length of your quiz and keep participants engaged. 

To combine two or more questions into one slide, follow these steps:

1. **Add Your Questions**: First, ensure that you have your questions ready in your Product Recommendation Quiz. Adding questions is the preliminary step before you can begin merging them into a single slide.
2. **Open Question Settings**: Click on the first question (the one you wish to appear at the top of the slide) to select it, then click on the wrench icon to open the [question settings](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#question-settings).
3. **Join Next Question**: Within the question settings menu, look for the option labeled `Join next question` and activate it.

    Once activated, the selected question will automatically merge with the next one, displaying both on the same slide.

4. **Merge Additional Questions**: If you wish to merge more than two questions you can continue the process.
5. **Select the Joined Questions:** Click on the last question of the already merged set.
6. **Repeat the Join Process:** Activate the `Join next question` option again. You can repeat this process to combine as many questions as you like, creating a comprehensive slide that houses multiple queries.

!!! info

    Please note that currently, merging two `file upload` questions into a single slide is not supported. If your quiz includes file upload questions, you must keep them separated to ensure the upload functionality works correctly.
