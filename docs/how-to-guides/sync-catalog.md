# How to Run a Catalog Sync

If you're missing products or collections from the list in the [Link Products](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/) or [Link Collections/Categories](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/) tab, you can run a product sync from the app's dashboard.

This article will guide you through troubleshooting and syncing your product catalog with the RevenueHunt app.

## Sync Your Products with the App

=== "Shopify"

    </div>

    1. **Navigate to Dashboard:** Log in to your [Dashboard](/reference/dashboard/) and locate the [Success Checklist](/reference/dashboard/#success-checklist).
    2. **Initiate Manual Sync:** Under the `SYNC PRODUCTS FROM YOUR STORE` section, click the `run manual sync` button. The sync takes about 30-60 minutes to complete depending on the size of your catalog.

=== "Shopify V2"

    In Shopify V2, your product catalog is synced in real time, so there's typically no need to run a manual sync.

    However, if you need to force a catalog sync:

    1. **Navigate to App Settings:** Go to [App Settings > Catalogue](/reference/app-settings/#catalogue).
    2. **Initiate Manual Sync:** Click the `Import catalogue` button to trigger a manual sync.

    The real-time sync feature ensures your products and collections are always up to date, making manual syncs generally unnecessary.
