## Sync Your Products with the App

    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l-JPWb82zNA?si=AtL09re7OHc6fKXL" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

    In the `💎Built for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app, your product catalog is synced in real time, so there's typically no need to run a manual sync.

    However, if you need to force a catalog sync:

    1. **Navigate to App Settings:** Go to [App Settings > Catalogue](/reference/app-settings/#catalogue).
    2. **Initiate Manual Sync:** Click the `Import catalogue` button to trigger a manual sync.

    The real-time sync feature ensures your products and collections are always up to date, making manual syncs generally unnecessary.
