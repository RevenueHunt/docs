# How to Run a Catalog Sync

If you're missing products or collections from the list in the [Link Products](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#link-products) or [Link Collections](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#link-collections) tab, you can run a product sync from the app's dashboard.

This article will guide you through troubleshooting and syncing your product catalog with the Shop Quiz app.

1. **Navigate to Dashboard:** Log in to your [Dashboard](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/dashboard/) and locate the [Success Checklist](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/dashboard/#success-checklist).
2. **Initiate Manual Sync:** Under the `SYNC PRODUCTS FROM YOUR STORE` section, click the `run manual sync` button. The sync takes about 30-60 minutes to complete depending on the size of your catalog.

## Sync Details

- If you've **just installed the app**, remember that syncing your store's entire product catalog for the first time can take a bit. Depending on your catalog size, expect to wait anywhere from **30 minutes to several hours** for the sync to complete.
- Only products marked as **active** will be synced with the app and appear in dropdown choices. **Draft or Archived products are excluded** from the sync and will not be visible.
- You can manually sync your store **every 6 hours**. Additionally, our app automatically performs a sync every 24 hours to keep your catalog current.
- For optimal results, make any necessary updates or changes to your store before triggering a manual sync. This ensures your latest product information is accurately reflected in the app.

## Troubleshooting Sync Issues

- **Check Sync Status:** If your products or collections aren't showing up as expected, or if the product counts remain at zero, it's possible the initial sync is still in progress or has encountered an issue.
- **Contact Support:** Should issues persist beyond the expected sync time, please [contact our support team](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/contact-customer-support/). We can manually initiate a complete sync of your shop to ensure everything is up-to-date.
