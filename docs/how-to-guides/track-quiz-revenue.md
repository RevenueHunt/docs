# How to Track Quiz Revenue

Understanding the revenue generated from quizzes on your Shopify store can provide valuable insights into customer engagement and the effectiveness of your marketing strategies. 

The [**Shopify Revenue Report**](#activate-shopify-revenue-report) feature within the Shop Quiz app allows you to track orders tagged by your quiz, offering a clear view of its impact on sales. 

This how-to article guides you through the process of setting up your Shopify Revenue Report and accessing vital orders data from the quiz.

Alternatively, you can track quiz revenue with [Google Analytics](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/).
