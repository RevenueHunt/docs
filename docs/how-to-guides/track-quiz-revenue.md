# How to Track Quiz Revenue

Understanding the revenue generated from quizzes on your eCommerce store can provide valuable insights into customer engagement and the effectiveness of your marketing strategies. 

=== "Shopify"

    The [**Shopify Revenue Report**](#activate-shopify-revenue-report) feature within the RevenueHunt app allows you to track orders tagged by your quiz, offering a clear view of its impact on sales. 

    This how-to article guides you through the process of setting up your Shopify Revenue Report and accessing vital orders data from the quiz.

    Alternatively, you can track quiz revenue with [Google Analytics](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/).

    ## Activate Shopify Revenue Report

    To enable the automated revenue report feature:

    1. **Enable Order Notes**: You need to enable Order Notes in your Theme Settings for this feature to work. Follow [these instructions](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/themes-by-shopify/vintage-themes/customizing-vintage-themes/get-more-information-with-order-notes) to enable them or contact your theme developer.
    2. **Open the Connect tab**: Open the RevenueHunt app and navigate to the [Connect](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) tab.
    3. **Conect to Shopify Reprots**: Scroll down to find the **Shopify Revenue Report (Beta)** section. Click on the `Connect` button within the Shopify Revenue Report (Beta) section.
    4. **Give consent**: The system will ask for your consent to access orders. Once accepted, it will establish a connection between the RevenueHunt app and your Shopify account, allowing the app to start gathering order data tagged by the quiz.
    5. **Publish the changes**: Click on the top-right `Publish` button to updated the quiz preview/live quiz and save the changes.

    After the connection is successfully established, you can access the revenue data generated from your quizzes. Go to the [`Metrics > Analytics`](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#analytics) section within the RevenueHunt app. Here, you will find the following information:

    ![how to track revenue report metrics](/images/how_to_track_revenue_report_metrics.png)

    - **Number of Orders**: Displays the number of people who placed an order after completing the quiz.
    - **Total Orders Value**: Shows the total value of all orders placed following quiz completion.
    - **Avg. Order Value**: Indicates the average value of orders placed post-quiz.

    !!! warning

         Shopify Revenue Tracking and Orders Tagging only works if the customer adds the products to the cart directly from the quiz results page **AND** if they immediately proceed to the cart after the quiz, and then right away complete the purchase. If they purchase at a later date, this revenue will not be attributed to the quiz anymore.
         
         Make sure your Results Page Checkout settings are correctly set to `proceed to cart` (not `proceed to checkout` or `link to product`). To change your checkout settings, check [this guide](/how-to-guides/change-checkout-settings/).
