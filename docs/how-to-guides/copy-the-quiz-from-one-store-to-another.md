# How to Copy the Quiz from One Store to Another

Transferring a quiz from one store to another with the Shop Quiz app is straightforward. This process allows you to duplicate your quiz design, questions, tags, and the results page, however, **products and collections will not be transferred** due to differing product IDs in the new store.

Before you begin, ensure the [Shop Quiz app](https://revenuehunt.com/product-recommendation-quiz-shopify/) is installed on both the original and the new store.

## Step 1: Generate Export Quiz Code

First, navigate to the quiz you wish to export:

1. Go to [Quiz Settings > General](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#general).
2. Click on **Export quiz to another store**. A popup will display a unique code.
3. **Copy this code** immediately. It remains valid for only 1 hour.

    !!! tip
        
        To prevent loss, save the export quiz code in a text file.

## Step 2: Log in to the Other Store

Ensure you're logged into the destination store:

1. Log in to the new store's Shopify account in an Incognito/Private browsing mode. This way you can avoid being logged into multiple accounts on the same browser and prevent caching issues.
2. Open the Shop Quiz app from the store's dashboard.


## Step 3: Import the Quiz

Finally, import the quiz into your new store:

1. In the Shop Quiz app, navigate to the [Dashboard](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/dashboard/).
2. Click on the [New Quiz](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/dashboard/#new-quiz) option.
3. Choose **import a quiz from another store** and paste the previously generated code.
