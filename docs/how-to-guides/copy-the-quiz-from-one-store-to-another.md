# How to Copy the Quiz from One Store to Another

Transferring a quiz from one store to another with the Shop Quiz: Product Recommendation Quiz app is straightforward. This process allows you to duplicate your quiz design, questions, tags, and the results page, however, **products and collections will not be transferred** due to differing product IDs in the new store.

Before you begin, ensure the [Shop Quiz: Product Recommendation Quiz app](https://revenuehunt.com/product-recommendation-quiz-shopify/) is installed on both the original and the new store.

    2. Click on **Export quiz to another store**. A popup will display a unique code.
    3. **Copy this code** immediately. It remains valid for only 1 hour.

## Changing Domains

Follow these steps if you plan to change the domain on which the Shop Quiz: Product Recommendation Quiz app is installed.

=== "Shopify"

    If you’re only changing the domain name (from `example.com` to `example-two.com`) and NOT changing the Shopify account (aka `.myshopify.com` address) the process shouldn’t disturb the Shop Quiz: Product Recommendation Quiz app and your quizzes. You can do so safely.

    If you’re changing the `.myshopify` account, then check [this guide](#how-to-copy-the-quiz-from-one-store-to-another) to copy the quiz from one store to another. After the quiz is copied, you may need to link your products to choices again, as they will have different product IDs in your new store. Make sure you’re **not** logged into two Shopify accounts at the same time on the same browser. This may cause caching issues. Instead, use Incognito / Private browsing for the second account.
