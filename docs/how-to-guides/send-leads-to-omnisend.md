## Link Quiz to Omnisend

=== "Shopify (Legacy)"

    1. **Add an email question**: Ensure your quiz includes an [**email question**](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#email), as this is essential for sending data to Omnisend. If an email question is missing, you can add one from the `+ Add Question` menu or insert an email block into an existing question.
    2. **Generate Omnisend API Key**: First, you'll have to [generate a new API Key in Omnisend](https://app.omnisend.com/integrations/api-keys). 

        - Log in to your Omnisend account.
        - Go to **Store Settings** > **API** and create a new API key.
        - Name the key (e.g., 'Skincare Basic API Key for Quiz', 'RevenueHunt API Key', etc.) and grant all permissions.
        - Copy the generated API key.

        ![how to send leads to omnisend api key generate](/images/how_to_omnisend_create_api_key.png){:width="500px"}

    4. In the popup/field that appears, you'll need to enter your `Omnisend API Key` into the input field, then click `Save`.
    5. Update the preview/live quiz with the top-right `Publish` button to save the connection. 
    6. **Preview your quiz**: After connecting to Omnisend, preview your quiz all the way to the results page to send the first contact. Use a sample email (e.g., 'alexa@example.com') and provide sample answers to populate properties in Omnisend.
    7. **Check your profile**: Go back to the Omnisend platform and navigate to the **Dashboard** > **Audience** > **Contacts**. Check if the sample profile (e.g., 'Alexa RevenueHunt / alexa@example.com') has been added. Click on the profile to view all custom properties from the quiz, including:

## Send Follow-up Emails with Omnisend

=== "Shopify (Legacy)"   

    It’s possible to set up a post-quiz email campaign in Omnisend to send the product recommendations or other offers to the quiz participants. 
    
    Below you’ll find some basic instructions that you can follow to set up an email flow in Omnisend. It covers creating a segment for quiz takers, setting up an automation workflow, and customizing email content with quiz results.

    !!! warning

        Email templates and flows are not something that’s a one-click install. It should be built by someone with technical knowledge and experience in Omnisend.

        Once the quiz is connected to Omnisend (and the data is sent there), it’s out of our app’s scope, and any particular questions on how to set up the flows and how to build the email templates should be directed to Omnisend.

    1. **Connect Your Quiz to Omnisend**: Refer to the instructions provided [here](#link-quiz-to-omnisend) to ensure your quiz is correctly connected to Omnisend.
    2. **Create a Segment for Quiz Participants**: In Omnisend, [create a segment](https://support.omnisend.com/en/articles/1400415-creating-segments) specifically for users who have completed the quiz. This can be done by filtering for a `custom property` that only quiz participants will have, such as `permalink_quiz_id`.

        ![how to omnisend segment](/images/how_to_omnisend_create_segment.png)

        - Use the custom properties to create a segment for users who took the quiz. Select a property (e.g., `permalink_quiz_id`) and copy it.
        - Go to 'Audience' > 'Segments' and create a new segment from scratch.
        - Add a filter using the copied property.
        - Name the segment something recognizable, e.g., 'Skincare Quiz Basic Segment' and save it.
        - Omnisend will automatically add profiles with this property to the segment.


    3. **Set Up an Automated Workflow**: Develop an [automation workflow](https://support.omnisend.com/en/articles/3954813-omnisend-automation-workflow-settings) in Omnisend that triggers when someone is added to the newly created segment of quiz participants. This step involves configuring Omnisend to automatically start the email campaign sequence for users in this segment.

        ![how to omnisend flow](https://loom.com/i/2e3ebc719c764822935b79d68c67456b?workflows_screenshot=true)

        - Navigate to the 'Automation' section in OmniSend.
        - Explore existing workflows or create a new workflow from scratch.
        - Set a trigger for the workflow: select 'When someone enters the segment' and choose the segment you created, e.g., 'Skincare Quiz Basic Segment'.
        - Save the changes to initiate the workflow when users enter the segment.

    4. **Customize the Email Template**: Customizing the email template to include quiz results and product recommendations requires HTML, CSS, and [Django templating](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/templates/builtins/) knowledge. Use Omnisend’s existing email templates as a base and modify them to incorporate the quiz data as custom properties. Ensure the template aligns with your brand’s style guide.

        - Drag and drop an email action below the trigger in the workflow.
        - Set the email subject (e.g., 'Your Quiz Results') and add a subheader.
        - Edit the email content as needed, then save changes to access the email editor.

    5. To get you started, you can use the [Sample Quiz Results Email Templates](#email-templates) we provide or [use the custom properties](#use-quiz-data-in-omnisend-email-templates) we sent to your Omnisend account to build your own email template.
    6. **Preview and test the email**: Preview and test the email as one of the segment subscribers. Complete any additional follow-up steps in the workflow.
    7. **Save all changes and start the workflow**: Save all changes and start the workflow to activate the automation for quiz takers.

    It’s possible to set up a post-quiz email campaign in Omnisend to send the product recommendations or other offers to the quiz participants. 
    
    Below you’ll find some basic instructions that you can follow to set up an email flow in Omnisend. It covers creating a segment for quiz takers, setting up an automation workflow, and customizing email content with quiz results.

    !!! warning

        Email templates and flows are not something that’s a one-click install. It should be built by someone with technical knowledge and experience in Omnisend.

        Once the quiz is connected to Omnisend (and the data is sent there), it’s out of our app’s scope, and any particular questions on how to set up the flows and how to build the email templates should be directed to Omnisend.

    1. **Connect Your Quiz to Omnisend**: Refer to the instructions provided [here](#link-quiz-to-omnisend) to ensure your quiz is correctly connected to Omnisend.
    2. **Create a Segment for Quiz Participants**: In Omnisend, [create a segment](https://support.omnisend.com/en/articles/1400415-creating-segments) specifically for users who have completed the quiz. This can be done by filtering for a `custom property` that only quiz participants will have, such as `permalink_quiz_id`.

        ![how to omnisend segment](/images/how_to_omnisend_create_segment.png)

        - Use the custom properties to create a segment for users who took the quiz. Select a property (e.g., `permalink_quiz_id`) and copy it.
        - Go to 'Audience' > 'Segments' and create a new segment from scratch.
        - Add a filter using the copied property.
        - Name the segment something recognizable, e.g., 'Skincare Quiz Basic Segment' and save it.
        - Omnisend will automatically add profiles with this property to the segment.


    3. **Set Up an Automated Workflow**: Develop an [automation workflow](https://support.omnisend.com/en/articles/3954813-omnisend-automation-workflow-settings) in Omnisend that triggers when someone is added to the newly created segment of quiz participants. This step involves configuring Omnisend to automatically start the email campaign sequence for users in this segment.

    4. **Customize the Email Template**: Customizing the email template to include quiz results and product recommendations requires HTML, CSS, and [Django templating](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/templates/builtins/) knowledge. Use Omnisend’s existing email templates as a base and modify them to incorporate the quiz data as custom properties. Ensure the template aligns with your brand’s style guide.

### Display a Link to the Quiz Results in an email


=== "Shopify (Legacy)"

    Use the `permalink_koHP8VA` in your email template. This property already contains a full url to the quiz results page.

    !!! example

        `<a href="{{ contact.custom.permalink_koHP8VA }}">View your quiz results</a>`


=== "Shopify"

    Use the `quiz_QUIZID_response_id` to create a link to the quiz results page. Just add `#response-{{ person|lookup:'quiz_QUIZID_response_id' }}` to the end of your results page href attribute in any link or URL. 


    !!! example

        `<a href="https://yourwebsite.com/#response-{{ contact.custom.quiz_lBJ9bk_response_id }}">View your quiz results</a>` 

        where `lBJ9bk` is the quiz ID and

        - `{{ contact.custom.quiz_lBJ9bk_response_id }}` fetches the dynamic response ID (e.g., eVgV0Y).

=== "WooCommerce"

    Use the `permalink_koHP8VA` in your email template. This property already contains a full url to the quiz results page.

    !!! example

        `<a href="{{ contact.custom.permalink_koHP8VA }}">View your quiz results</a>`

### Customer Tags in Omnisend

Note that while customer profiles are updated with new quiz takes—including answers and product recommendations—Omnisend does not automatically remove unselected tags from previous sessions. A `tags_quizID` property is used to track the latest customer tags, which can be utilized to create segmented audiences for targeted marketing efforts.



### Email Templates

=== "Shopify (Legacy)"

    Here are some email templates that you can use as a reference:

    - [Basic Slots Template (4-Step Skincare Routine)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wy-_nb0nGyU0_NsWB6YZMiXbXiA2sMyrGu6ks7TqzjQ/edit?usp=sharing)
    - [Advanced Slots Template (Morning & Night Routine)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RIXL2zF0ErGbUX5IwCRXjnr8bNV3wXuZQuuy3NmbL_I/edit?usp=sharing)
    - [Products List Template (Coffee Recommendations)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/175YmJpZ_iTahGFip46MGb6fcn5cupNsCEuZFxMnFCAg/edit?usp=sharing)

    Bear in mind that the templates won’t work by just copy/pasting. These templates were created for our demo quiz. Your developer will have to modify the `custom properties` in these templates to match the ones that are passed from the quiz to your Omnisend account. The `quiz ID` is different, so are other property names. After the changes are made, your developer can insert the code as a `custom HTML block` on the Omnisend email template.

=== "Shopify"

    In the [Integrations](/reference/quiz-builder/connect-integrations/) section, under `Omnisend`, you can find the `omnisend template`. 
    
    ![how to shopifyv2 omnisend template](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_omnisend_template.png)
    
    Click on the button to receive and copy an HTML email template specifically tailored for the quiz.
