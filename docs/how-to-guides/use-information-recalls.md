## Where to Add Information Recalls

Information recall can be utilized in various parts of your quiz to enhance personalization:

- **Follow-up Questions:** Make your quiz feel more conversational by recalling the participant's name or other responses in later questions.
- **Results Page:** Display personalized messages or recommendations on the results page by recalling the participant's name and answers.
- **Email Communications:** Beyond the quiz itself, recall information in your [follow-up emails](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/) to provide a cohesive and personalized experience from start to finish. Personalize follow-up emails by including the participant's name in the subject line or email body. Use the "@" symbol to access and insert the participant's name and other relevant information into your email content.
