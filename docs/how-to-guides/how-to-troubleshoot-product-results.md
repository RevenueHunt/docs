# How to Troubleshoot Product Recommendations in Your Quiz

Navigating through the maze of product recommendations can be challenging, especially when dealing with numerous products and collections linked to quiz choices. This guide will walk you through the process of uncovering the reasons behind product recommendations or their absence on the Results Page.

## Understanding the Basics

When a particular product appears (or fails to appear) on the Results Page, it's crucial to understand the mechanism behind its selection. This involves tracing back to the quiz responses and analyzing the [voting system](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/how-to-recommend-products/#voting-system) that influences product visibility.

## Step-by-Step Process to Investigate Recommendations

1. **Access Quiz Metrics**: Firstly, navigate to the quiz [Metrics]() in your dashboard. Here, you will find a wealth of information regarding quiz interactions.
2. **Explore Responses**: Within Metrics, locate and open the Responses tab. Choose a specific response that captures your interest to delve deeper into the product recommendation dynamics.
3. **Review the Results Page**: Use the provided link at the bottom of the response details to access the Results Page corresponding to the chosen response. Identify a product of interestâ€”either one that appeared unexpectedly on the Results Page or one you anticipated but was missing.
4. **Conduct a Product Search**: Utilize the search bar at the top of the Responses section to input the name of the product in question. Select the product from the search results to further investigate its recommendation status.

    **Understanding Product Status Colors**

    - **Green**: Indicates products that received votes through the quiz choices.
    - **Red**: Denotes products that were explicitly excluded from recommendations.
    - **White**: Represents products that did not receive any votes, hence their absence from the recommendations.

5. **Analyze Product Details**: Upon selecting a product, a detailed panel will reveal critical information.

    Information such as:

    - The collections the product belongs to.
    - The number of votes it received and the reasons for its recommendation or absence.
    - The questions/choices that influenced its votes, including the collections where it was either upvoted or excluded.
    - The specific Results Page and Slots or Product blocks that facilitated its recommendation.

6. **Troubleshooting and Adjustments**: With this information, you can pinpoint inconsistencies or errors in product categorization, inclusion, or exclusion. 

    Additionally, you may:

    - **Recalculate Recommendations**: If adjustments to the quiz or product collections have been made, use this option to see how these changes affect recommendations.
    - **Resend Notifications**: Useful for updating CRM services or sending revised recommendations via email.

**Pro Tip**

A common issue is a product being misclassified into an incorrect collection or accidentally excluded in quiz settings. Paying close attention to these details can significantly enhance the accuracy of your product recommendations.

By following this guide, you will be better equipped to understand and refine the product recommendation process within your quiz, ensuring a more relevant and personalized customer experience.
