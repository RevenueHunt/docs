# How to Create and Publish Your First Shop Quiz

## Step 1: Create a New Quiz
- Go to the appâ€™s [dashboard](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/dashboard/) and click [**"add new quiz"**](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/dashboard/#new-quiz).
- Choose a pre-defined template or start from scratch.
- Name your quiz. The name can be edited later.
- After that, you'll be redirected to the [Quiz Builder](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/).

## Step 2: Manage Questions

In [Quiz Builder](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/) you'll be able to add questions to your quiz.

- To add a question, click the **"+"** button or hover over an existing question and click the **"add new question"** button. 
- Select a [question type](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#question-types) from the dropdown.
- To **delete a question**, click the **"more options"** button (three dots) and select **"Delete"**.

## Step 3: Link Products and Collections to Choices

Once you have your questions, you'll have to link products to choices to show recommendations to the customer.

- In the Quiz Builder, go to [**"Link Products"**](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#link-products) or [**"Link Collections"**](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#link-collections) tab.
- Link product variants or collections to each choice. This determines the product recommendations based on customer responses. 
- In the end, the Results Page will display the products sorted by the number of votes.
- Go to the [Results Page](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#results-page) tab and edit the content.
- You can change the number of recommended products in the [Product Block settings](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#block-settings).

***How do I get the right recommendations?***

*Our product recommendation algorithm works like a voting system:*

- *Products are linked to each choice*
- *When a customer picks a choice, all linked products receive one vote*
- *After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted products sorted by the number of votes*
- *If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty*
- *If there's a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the order of products.*

*If you want to make the results ultra-precise, you can also:*

- *Limit the recommendations to only show products that received X votes or more in the [Results Page settings](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#advanced-settings).*
- *Use [Exclusions]() to make sure that unwanted products are not shown (even if they were upvoted in another choice earlier).*

## Step 4: Publish & Preview the Quiz

To test the quiz, you'll have to save the changes and preview it.

- Click [**"Publish"**](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#quiz-builder_1) on the top-right menu. Don't worry, clicking publish will not automatically add the quiz to your website. It will simply save the changes and allow you to preview the quiz.
- Click [**Preview**](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#quiz-builder_1) to test the quiz you've created in a new window. You can test the quiz as much as you like. These test responses are automatically removed after 1 hour to don't add to your usage quota. 

## Step 5: Publish the Quiz on Your website

Once you're satisfied with your quiz, you can put it on your website. 

- Follow this guide on [How to Publish the Quiz on Your Website](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/how-to-publish-quiz/) to learn about different ways the quiz can be added.

## After Publishing
- If changes are made post-publishing, click **"Publish"** again to update the live quiz.
