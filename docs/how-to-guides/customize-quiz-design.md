### Advanced Customizations (CSS)

=== "Shopify"

    For those with coding knowledge, the `Advanced` customization panel within the [Quiz Design](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-design/) offers the flexibility to input custom CSS, allowing you to override the default styles. This option provides maximum control over every detail of your quiz’s appearance.

    ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_quizdesign_advanced](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_quizdesign_advanced.png)

    !!! tip "Get help with custom CSS"

        Click `✨Get help with custom CSS` to open a chat window with the Quiz Copilot AI. It can directly make design changes with CSS code!
    

    Once you've made your changes, click the `Save` button at the top right to apply them to your live or preview quiz.

    To add custom CSS code to a **speciifc quiz section only**, go to [`Question Settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).
    
    To add custom CSS code to a **specific results page only**, go to [`Results Page Settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/).

    !!! tip "Tips for using CSS"

        - **Check the App CSS Structure**: For a detailed overview of the CSS structure of the app and CSS examples, see the [App CSS Structure](/reference/css-structure/) reference.

        - **Find an Element Selector**: To target a specific element in your quiz, right-click on it in your browser and select `Inspect` to view the element’s selector.

        - **Add Specificity to CSS Rules**: Use specific selectors to apply styles only to particular parts of your quiz. 
        
            !!! example "Example: Add Specificity to CSS Rules"

                ```css
                #quiz p { color: red; }
                ```
                This rule will change the color of all paragraphs in the quiz to red.

                To style a paragraph in only one specific question, use the question's unique ID:

                ```css
                #question-AbC7Zde p { color: red; }
                ```
                In this case, the color of the paragraph will change to red only for the question with ID `AbC7Zde`. You can find a question’s ID in [`Quiz Builder > Question Settings`](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-settings).



    !!! example "Example: Upload a Google Font with CSS"

        3. **Write CSS code**: To add a Google font to the quiz elements (h1-h6, p) use this sample code:

                @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Quicksand&display=swap');

                .quicksand-font {
                font-family: "Quicksand", serif;
                font-optical-sizing: auto;
                font-weight: 400;
                font-style: normal;
                }

## Styling Quiz Text

=== "Shopify"

    To personalize the text within each question, open the [**`Block Settings`**](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) for each content block. 
    
    Each block type — Heading, Text, or Button —has unique customization options that let you control the styling and positioning of text elements.

    **Heading Block**

    ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_questions_blocksettings_heading](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_questions_blocksettings_heading.png){width="300"}

    To add a heading to your question, select the `Heading` block. The `Block Settings` for the heading allow you to:

    - **Style Text**: You can bold, italicize, underline, or strikethrough text within the heading, as well as insert links and pull content dynamically from other parts of the quiz.
    - **Size and Alignment**: Adjust the heading size and choose from alignment options (left, center, or right) to fit your design needs.

    **Text Block**

    ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_questions_blocksettings_text](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_questions_blocksettings_text.png){width="300"}

    Use the `Text` block to add regular text content to your question. Within the [**`Block Settings`**](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) for text, you can:

    - **Format Text**: Similar to the heading block, you can bold, italicize, underline, or strikethrough text, add links, and dynamically source content.
    - **Size and Alignment**: Change the text size and alignment to suit the layout and readability of your quiz.

    **Button Block**

    ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_questions_blocksettings_button](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_questions_blocksettings_button.png){width="300"}

    To include a button within your question, select the `Button` block. The [**`Block Settings`**](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings) for buttons allow you to:

    - **Button Text**: Customize the default text displayed on the button to reflect the action you want users to take.
    - **Button Alignment**: Adjust the button's position (left, center, or right) for a balanced layout within the quiz.

    By adjusting these settings, you can tailor the styling of each text element to enhance user experience and reinforce your brand’s design.


=== "Shopify (Legacy)"

    You can use [Markdown Language](/how-to-guides/use-markdown/) for basic styling of text in the quiz. 

    ??? question "What is Markdown Languge?"
            
        Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters, like `#` or `*`.

    If you need to include additional styling and elements in your questions, choices, and results page, you can do so using Markdown Language.

    - **Headings**
        ```html
        # H1
        ## H2
        ### H3
        ```

        ```html

In addition to the basic elements, you can set a unique background image for each result page through the [results page settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/). You can also use these settings to apply [custom JavaScript](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) to your quiz design.

If you find the default results page too restrictive, you might want to **create a custom results page** on your site and direct all quiz data to it using the [Callback Function](/how-to-guides/use-callback-function/). This function enables you to collect all quiz responses in JSON format on any page you choose.

## Customization Examples

We offer complete flexibility to developers for personalizing both the quiz and the results page. Take a look at [these examples](https://revenuehunt.com/templates/#customization) to discover the various designs you can achieve with our app using some creativity and CSS code.
