??? question "What is Jump Logic?"

    Jump Logic operates on conditional statements, similar to the `IF-THEN-ELSE` logic found in programming. It enables the quiz creator to direct participants to different follow-up questions or content based on their responses to previous questions. This is particularly useful in creating quizzes that adapt to the user's input, offering a personalized path through the quiz.

    For instance, in a skincare consult quiz, you may start with a question about the participant's skin type (Dry, Normal, Combination, or Oily). Based on the answer, Jump Logic can direct the participant to questions specifically relevant to their skin type, thereby skipping irrelevant questions and tailoring the quiz experience.

!!! warning

    It is advised not to mix [Jump Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) and [Skip Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#skip-logic) in one quiz. Mixing logic rules can lead to unexpected results.

## Add Jump Logic to Questions

Jump Logic allows you to route customers to different questions based on their responses.

!!! info

    All the Jump Logic rules follow the same format:

    - **IF response to** pick the question from a dropdown list
    - **is**/ **is not** pick a choice from the dropdown list
    - **THEN go to:** pick a slide from the dropdown list or add a URL 

=== "Shopify"

    1. Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/).
    2. **Open Jump Logic**: Navigate to the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab and select [`Jump Logic`](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/#jump-logic) section.
    3.  **Add Jump Logic**: Click `Add Jump Logic` to add a new Jump Logic rule for the selected question. Here, you'll define your conditional statement using the template:
        - IF the response to `question X`
        - IS EQUAL TO `choice Y`
        - THEN go to `question Z`

        !!! example

            ![quiz builder conditional logic jump logic rule](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogicrule.png){width="500"}

            In the example, if a user chooses a choice "Myself" in Question 1 "Who are you shopping for?" then they will be redirected to Question 2 "What is your skin type?".

    4. **Multiple Conditions:** You can add more than one Jump Logic rule to a single question by clicking on the big `+` button in the bottom right corner. This allows for complex paths that can direct participants to various follow-up questions based on their specific answers.

        - **+** - Add another Jump Logic rule. Adds a new OR logical rule.

            !!! example

                ![quiz builder conditional logic jump logic OR rule](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogicrule_or.png)

                In the example, if a user chooses a choice "Myself" in Question 1 "Who are you shopping for?" then they will be redirected to Question 2 "What is your skin type?" but if the user chooses a choice "A gift" in Question 1 "Who are you shopping for?" then they will be redirected to Question 4 "What is their skin type?".

        - **bin** - Delete the current Jump Logic rule.
        - **+ add concurrent logic** - Adds a new AND logical statement to the same rule. AND conditional statements can be tricky, as both statements have to be true for the rule to take effect. For most quizzes, using the OR rule is enough.

            !!! example

                ![quiz builder conditional logic jump logic AND rule](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogicrule_and.png){width="500"}

                In the example, **only if** a user chooses a choice "Myself" in Question 1 "Who are you shopping for?" **and** a choice "Dry" in Question 2 "What is your skin type?" they will be redirected to Question 3 "What's your age?".

        - **Always jump to:** - Select a slide or URL where the user will be always redirected after this slide.

    5. **Preview and Adjust:** Publish the changes with the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz and test the setup.

        - THEN go to `question Z`

        !!! example

            ![quiz builder conditional logic jump logic rule](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogic_example.png)

            In the example, if a user chooses a choice "Oily all over" in Question 4 "SKIN TYPE" then they will be redirected to Question 8 "SKIN TYPE: OILY".

    4. **Multiple Conditions:** You can add more than one Jump Logic rule to a single question by clicking on the big `+ Add another rule (OR)` button in the bottom right corner. This allows for complex paths that can direct participants to various follow-up questions based on their specific answers.

        - **+ Add another rule (OR)** - Add another Jump Logic rule. Adds a new OR logical rule.

            !!! example

                ![quiz builder conditional logic jump logic OR rule](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_jumplogic_exampleOR.png)

                In the example, if a user chooses a choice "Oily all over" in Question 4 "SKIN TYPE" then they will be redirected to Question 8 "SKIN TYPE: OILY" but if the user chooses a choice "Oily in certain spots" in Question 4 "SKIN TYPE" then they will be redirected to Question 6 "SKIN TYPE: COMBINATION".

        - **bin** - Delete the current Jump Logic rule.
        - **+ Add concurrent logic (AND)** - Adds a new AND logical statement to the same rule. AND conditional statements can be tricky, as both statements have to be true for the rule to take effect. For most quizzes, using the OR rule is enough.

## Examples and Applications

### Branching the Quiz

=== "Shopify"


    ![how to hide content with logic jump logic](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_jump_logic.png){width="500"}

    1. **Create Quiz**: Open the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/) and add a `Multiple choice question` asking the customer about their skin type: Dry, Normal, Oily, or Combination-type skin. 

        !!! tip

            Use the description box in `Question Settings -> Show Description` to help customers determine their skin type.

    2. **Create Statement Questions**: Add multiple `Statement` slides describing the specific skin type and its challenges. For example:

        !!! example

            - *You have Dry Skin*: The itchiness, tightness and dryness â€“ we know your struggle! Your skin wants a routine thatâ€™s deeply nourishing and hydrating.
            - *You have Normal Skin*: Your skin feels balanced, just like you! Even though your skin doesnâ€™t experience major issues, it deserves amazing care! Your skin wants a routine that sustains your skinâ€™s natural harmony.
            - *You have Oily Skin*: Your skin is oh-so shiny, but with excess oil instead of your natural glow! Your skin wants a routine that reduces oil to provide balance and clarity, all while giving your skin the proper amount of light hydration.
            - *You have Combination-Type Skin*: Your skin has multiple things going on at once: you experience your T-zone to be on the oily side, while the rest of your face is either normal or dry.

    3. **Add Jump Logic**: If we donâ€™t add jump logic to the quiz, our statement questions will just appear one after the other, regardless of the choice we made. To add jump logic, you should go back to the skin type question and select [conditional logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/). Set up `IF-THEN` statements with `OR` logic to direct the customer to the correct text based on their skin type. 

        ![how to hide content with logic jump logic statement](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_jump_logic_statement.png)

    4. **Add "Always Jump to..." Logic**: Once all the statements are linked with logic to the skin type question, you should point each statement to the next question in the quiz. This is done by going to the [jump logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/) tab and scrolling toward the `Always jump to...` section. Point each statement to the next question.

    4. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.



=== "Shopify V2"

    Jump Logic allows you to branch the quiz based on the participant's responses.

    For example, you can create a quiz that asks the participant about their skin type and then based on the answer, you can redirect them to a different question or content.

    ![how to use jump logic](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_jump_logic_default_destination.png)

    **How to set this up?**

    **Step 1: Add Questions and Follow-up Statements** Create a quiz with a main question and follow-up questions or statement. For example, a skincare quiz with a skin type question and four different texts based on user responses.

    ![how to use jump logic](https://loom.com/i/11c8cff2e27a451a8c8b40b348de4a42?workflows_screenshot=true)

    **Step 2: Add Jump Logic** Add Jump Logic to the main question. Navigate to the [Conditional Logic](/reference/quiz-builder/conditional-logic/) tab. Select the main question, in this example it's the skin type question (Question 4).

    Add Jump Logic rules for each skin type response, like the following example:

    ![how to use jump logic](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_jump_logic_rule.png){width="300"}

    - Dry and tight all over â†’ Dry skin type statement
    - Not too oily, not too dry â†’ Normal skin type
    - Oily in certain spots â†’ Combination skin type
    - Oily all over â†’ Oily skin type.


    **Step 3: Adjust Default Destinations for Each Statement** Change default destinations for each skin type text.

    ![how to use jump logic](/images/how_to_hide_content_with_logic_shopifyv2_jump_logic_rule2.png){width="300"}
    
    - Dry skin type â†’ Next question (skin concerns)
    - Combination skin type â†’ Next question (skin concerns)
    - Normal skin type â†’ Next question (skin concerns)
    - Oily skin type â†’ Next question (skin concerns).


    **Step 4: Save & Test the Logic** Save changes with the top-right `Save` button and `Preview` the quiz. Test each skin type option to ensure correct text is displayed.

### Jump Logic vs. Skip Logic

While Jump Logic and Skip Logic may seem similar, they serve distinct purposes. **Jump Logic** creates separate, divergent paths for participants based on their answers, effectively jumping to different questions or content. **Skip Logic**, on the other hand, determines if a question should be presented or skipped, maintaining a single path but customizing the questions seen by the participant. 

It's not recommended to use both Jump Logic and Skip Logic on one quiz.

## Additional Resources

Understanding conditional logic, the foundation of Jump Logic, can be challenging. Resources such as [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=A+AND+%28B+OR+C%29) and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/programming-101/boolean-logic/a/compound-booleans-with-logical-operators) offer tutorials on AND/OR logic, which can enhance your ability to create effective and complex quiz flows.

---
Jump Logic is a versatile tool that enriches quizzes by introducing customized paths based on participant responses. By setting up conditional statements, quiz creators can design interactive and personalized experiences, ensuring that each participant's journey through the quiz is relevant to their inputs.
