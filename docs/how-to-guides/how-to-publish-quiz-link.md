# How to Set Up a Quiz Link Popup on Your Shopify Store

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a Quiz Link Popup on your Shopify store. This feature allows your customers to access a quiz through a popup by clicking on a link within your site's navigation menu or any page or blog post. It's a great way to engage visitors and collect valuable data.

Before you start, ensure you have access to your Shopify store's admin dashboard and have the necessary permissions to edit themes and navigation settings.
