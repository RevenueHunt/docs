## Step 3: Set up Product Recommendations

=== "Shopify"

    Once you have your questions, you'll have to link products to choices to show recommendations to the customer.

    1. **Go to Link Products/Collections/Choice Settings tab**: In the Quiz Builder, select a choice and go to [Link Products](/reference/quiz-builder/link-products/)/ [Link Collections](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/) / [Choice Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#choice-settings) tab.
    2. **Upvote Products**: Link product variants or collections to each choice. This determines the product recommendations based on customer responses. In the end, the Results Page will display the products sorted by the number of votes.
    3. **Edit the Results Page**: Go to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) tab and edit the content. You can change the number of recommended products in the [Product Block settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#block-settings).

    ??? question "How do I get the right recommendations?"

        Our product recommendation algorithm works like a voting system:

        - Products are linked to each choice
        - When a customer picks a choice, all linked products receive one vote
        - After the customer takes the quiz, the results page will show the most voted products sorted by the number of votes
        - If no products have been linked or all the products have been excluded, the results page will appear empty
        - If there's a draw in the number of votes, the app will randomize the order of products.

        If you want to make the results ultra-precise, you can also:

        - Limit the recommendations to only show products that received X votes or more in the [Results Page settings](/how-to-guides/only-recommend-products-with-minimum-votes/).
        - Use [Exclusions](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/#understanding-inclusion-and-exclusion) to make sure that unwanted products are not shown (even if they were upvoted in another choice earlier).

    Read more about how the recommendations work [here](/how-to-guides/recommend-products/).

=== "Shopify V2"

    Once you have your questions, you'll have to decide [how to set up product recommendations](/how-to-guides/set-up-recommendations/) that should be shown at the end of the quiz. 
    
    You can choose to:

    **Option 1**: Recommend most voted products based on the customer's answers *(recommended for most quizzes)*

    ![Recommend Most Voted Products](/images/how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_funnel.png){: width="500"}

    In this setup, you'll have to:
    
    - Link products or collections to each choice in the quiz. 
    - On the Results Page, add a product block that will recommend the most voted products based on the customer's answers.
    - You can also sort recommendations into multiple product slots to show a complete product routine.

    **Option 2**: Set up a custom varaible or a score that will determine what recommendations should be shown *(recommended for personality-type quizzes)*

    ![Scoring Quiz](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_scoringquiz_varaiblequiz.png){: width="500"}

    In this setup, you'll have to:

    - Create a custom variable or a score for each choices in the quiz. 
    - On the Results Page, set up multiple sections with fixed recommendations and content.
    - To each section, add display logic to tell it when to be shown or hidden based on the final score or variable with the most votes. 
    - *For example, show Section 1 if the varaibkle with the highest score is "blue" and Section 2 if the varaibkle with the highest score is "red".*

    **Option 3**: Set up a complex logic tree or add display logic to sections on the results page that will determine what recommendations should be shown *(recommended for quizzes with complex logic and recommendations matrix)*

    ![Recommendations Matrix](/images/how_to_shopify_v2_recommendations_logic.png){: width="500"}

    In this setup, you'll have to either:

    - Create complex logic branching in the quiz that leads the user to different results pages with fixed recomemendations and text 
    - Create one results page with multple sections and via display logic tell each section when to be shown or hidden based on the customer's answers.
