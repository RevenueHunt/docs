# How to Use Skip Logic

[Skip Logic](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#skip-logic) is a tool used in quizzes or surveys to make answering questions smoother for people taking them. It works by changing the order of questions based on the answers given to previous questions. This means if someone answers a question a certain way, they might skip some questions or see different ones next. 

The guide will show you how to set up and use Skip Logic, including some examples of how it works.

!!! warning

    It is advised not to mix [Jump Logic](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#jump-logic) and [Skip Logic](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#skip-logic) in one quiz. Mixing logic rules can lead to unexpected results.

    ![quiz builder conditional logic](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic.png)

    In the [Conditional Logic](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#conditional-logic) tab you can branch your quiz. The left menu allows you to add conditional logic rules to questions in the quiz. The right menu shows a logic tree of the quiz. Any branching you add will be reflected on the tree preview.

    By default, the quiz will progress from one question to another based on the question number. Conditional logic allows you to change this default behavior.

## Add Skip Logic to Questions

Skip Logic determines whether a question is presented or skipped based on responses to previous questions. By default, if no Skip Logic is added to a question, it will be shown.

!!! info

    All the Skip Logic rules follow the same format:

    - **IF response to** pick the question from a dropdown list
    - **is**/ **is not** pick a choice from the dropdown list
    - **THEN this question is skipped**

=== "Shopify"

    1. You can introduce Skip Logic into your quiz by accessing the [Conditional Logic settings](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#conditional-logic) of a question.
    2. Open the [Skip Logic](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#skip-logic) tab. 
    3. **Add Skip Logic**: From here, click `Add Skip Logic`. You can create a new Skip Logic statement specifying the conditions under which the current question should be bypassed. These statements follow a simple format: IF the answer to `question X` IS EQUAL TO `choice Y`, THEN skip this question. 

        !!! example

            ![quiz builder conditional logic skip logic rule](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_skiplogicrule.png)

            In the example, if a user chooses a choice "A gift" in Question 1 "Who are you shopping for?" then Question 2 "What is your skin type?" will be skipped (it will not be shown).

    4. All slides that contain Skip Logic will be marked with `"skip logic"` text.
    5. Multiple Skip Logic rules can be added to any question if needed.

        - **+** - Adds another Skip Logic rule. Adds a new OR logical rule.
        - **bin** - Delete the current Skip Logic rule.
        - **+ add concurrent logic** - Adds a new AND logical statement to the same rule. AND conditional statements can be tricky, as both statements have to be true for the rule to take effect. For most quizzes, using the OR rule is enough.

    5. **Preview and Adjust:** Publish the changes with the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz and test the setup.

## Examples and Applications

### Filtering Email Collection Based on Interest

**Scenario**

You want to collect emails from interested customers without deterring others.

![how to use skip logic example2](/images/how to use skip logic example2.png)

**Implementation**

- Start with a `Yes/No question` asking if the customer is willing to leave their email.
- Follow up with an `email` input question.
- Apply Skip Logic to the email question: if the customer opts out in the previous step, they are directed straight to the results page, bypassing the email question.

### Customizing Content Based on Skin Type

**Scenario**

You want to provide personalized advice based on the customer's skin type. Imagine creating a quiz that determines a personalized skincare routine. *Question 4* might ask about the participant's skin type, and depending on the answer, a different statement or recommendation about their skincare is shown. This individualized response is made possible by Skip Logic, which then continues the quiz based on the participant's specific path.

![how to use skip logic example](/images/how to hide content with logic skip logic.png)

**Implementation**

To learn how to build such a quiz check this [step-by-step guide](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/hide-content-with-logic/).

- Add a multiple-choice question about skin type (Dry, Normal, Oily, or Combination).
- Create separate statement questions for each skin type, detailing specific advice or information.
- Apply Skip Logic to ensure respondents see only the statement relevant to their skin type, creating a customized experience.

### Skip Logic vs. Jump Logic

The new app interface gives the option to use Jump Logic and Skip Logic. You shouldnâ€™t combine both types of logic in the same quiz.

- **Jump Logic** creates diverging paths within a quiz based on respondent answers, allowing for a branched experience.
- **Skip Logic**, in contrast, customizes the path by omitting certain questions based on previous answers, keeping the overall sequence intact but personalized.


## Additional Resources

Understanding conditional logic, the foundation of Skip Logic, can be challenging. Resources such as [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=A+AND+%28B+OR+C%29) and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/programming-101/boolean-logic/a/compound-booleans-with-logical-operators) offer tutorials on AND/OR logic, which can enhance your ability to create effective and complex quiz flows.
