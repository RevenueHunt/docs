=== "Shopify"

    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.34837355718783%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/36ed1600df294287bf24d94bc438d4c3?sid=7c53ed8e-ab4c-4276-88bd-0509cdf954b9" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

    **Step 1: Generate a Discount Code**

    To create a Shopify discount code, refer to [this helpful guide](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/discounts/create-discount-codes#create-a-fixed-value-or-percentage-discount). Activation of this code is necessary before integrating it with your quiz to ensure functionality at checkout. 

    It's essential to select the `manual` option for discount codes in Shopify, as our app can only synchronize with manually created codes.

    !!! note

        Please remember, that the management of these discounts is handled through Shopify, not directly within our app.

    **Step 2: Configure Your Discount Code on the Results Page**

    You can add Static or Dynamic discount codes to your quiz.

    **Static Discount**

    1. Navigate to [Results Page Settings > Discount Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#discounts-settings) and access the Discount Code Settings section. 
    2. Here, you'll find a `Code` field. This field is for entering the discount code that will be automatically applied at checkout.

        ![how to add discount static](/images/manual_quizbuilder_resultspage_settings_discount_discountcode.png){width="300"}

        `Visible discount` - Select the `discount %` from the dropdown. The percentage discount will be visible on the results page products. The discount code will be automatically redeemed at checkout.

        `Code` - Type a discount code that corresponds to this discount. You have to set up this discount code in your store > Shopify Discounts first.

    **Dynamic Discount**

    Our system supports the addition of multiple Shopify discount codes on the results page, applied dynamically according to the cart's total value. 

    1. Start by creating your Shopify discount codes as explained in [Step 1](#step-1-generating-a-discount-code-in-shopify). 
        
        !!! note

            Remember, only manual discount codes are compatible with our app.

    2. Proceed to the quiz's Results Page tab. Within [Results Page Settings > Discounts](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#discounts-settings), activate Dynamic Discounts. Click "activate" to open the discount menu.

        ![how to add discount dynamic](/images/manual_quizbuilder_resultspage_settings_discount_dynamicdiscounts.png){width="300"}

        `Enable notifications` - A toast notification will appear when a customer qualifies for a discount. Toggle to enable/disable.

        `Encourage discounts` - The notification will also include a message telling the customer how close they are to receiving the next highest discount. Toggle to enable/disable.

        **Discount [A] Settings**

        `Discount code` - Type a discount code that corresponds to this discount. You have to set up this discount code in your store > Shopify Discounts first.

        `Discount percentage` - Type the discount %. The percentage discount will be visible in the results page products. The discount code will be automatically redeemed at checkout.

        `Min. value in cart` - Type the value of products added to the cart on the results page above which the discount will be applied.

        `+ / add another discount` - Adds a new dynamic discount (Discount [B]).

        `bin / delete this discount` - deletes this dynamic discount.

        `add a discount` - Adds a new dynamic discount below (Discount [B]).

        `deactivate` - Deactivates dynamic discounts.

    **Step 3: Publish Changes**

    1. Click the top-right [`Publish` button](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/) to apply your changes to the live quiz/preview.

    **Alternatively**

    Your developer can also add a discount code to the results page using custom JavaScript code added to the Results page.
    
    !!! info

        Check out [this article](/how-to-guides/add-javascript/) for more information on how to add custom JavaScript code to your results page.

    !!! example 
        You can use this function 
        
        ```html

        /* set specific discount code \*/
        prq.setDiscountCode('10-OFF'); 

        ```
        to add a custom coupon or a discount code to the results page and apply it to all the products. Note, that this coupon code needs to be first set up in your store.

=== "WooCommerce"

    **Step 1: Generate a Discount Code**

    If your store is built on WooCommerce, you’ll need [the Advanced Coupons for WooCommerce plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-coupons-for-woocommerce-free/) for this to work.

    Create a coupon code, then navigate to the URL Coupons section. Make sure the Redirect To URL points to your cart page. Copy the URI (it’s the end part of the URL, excluding the https + your domain name):

    ![how to add discount woo step 1](/images/how_to_add_discount_woo_step_1.png)

    Example: if the Coupon URL which appears is `https://yourdomain.com/coupon/codexyz/`, then the part you need to copy is `/coupon/codexyz/`. 

    **Step 2: Configure Your Discount Code on the Results Page**

    Then in the Product Recommendation Quiz, go to the [Results Page Settings > Checkout Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) and paste the copied URI in the `Cart URL` field.

    ![how to add discount woo step 2](/images/how_to_add_discount_woo_step_2.png)

## Apply Discount Only if Customer Leaves Their Email

=== "Shopify"

[Multiple Results Pages Settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/#multiple-results-pages-settings) screen will appear and a second Results page will be added.

    2. You can then rename the page and edit it by clicking `edit`.
        ![how to add discount result pages](/images/how_to_add_discount_result_pages.png)
    3. **Add discount code**: In this case, *Results Page 1* will be left as default with no discount and the discount will be applied to *Results Page 2*. To do that, open the `Results Page 2 Settings -> Discount code settings -> Discount code` and click `add`. You can then edit the `Visible % discount` and add the code.

        !!! warning

            For the discount to work, you need to set it up first in your Shopify store. Check the [first part of this article](#how-to-add-a-discounts-to-your-quiz) for instructions.

        ![how to add discount email question](/images/how_to_add_discount_email_question.png)
