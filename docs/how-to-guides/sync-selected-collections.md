# How to Selectively Sync Product Collections with Shop Quiz

For stores with extensive product catalogs, especially those exceeding 5,000 items, it might not be practical or desirable to include every single product in your Shop Quiz recommendations. Fortunately, Shop Quiz offers a targeted solution: the `collections first` feature. 

The `collections first` feature allows you to prioritize which collections you want to sync with Shop Quiz, enhancing the quiz's performance and avoiding potential technical issues.
