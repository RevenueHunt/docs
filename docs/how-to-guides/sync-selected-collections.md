# How to Selectively Sync Product Collections with RevenueHunt app

For stores with extensive product catalogs, especially those exceeding 5,000 items, it might not be practical or desirable to include every single product in your quiz recommendations. Fortunately, RevenueHunt app offers a targeted solution: the `collections/categories first` feature. 

The `collections/categories first` feature allows you to prioritize which collections you want to sync with the Product Recommendation Quiz, enhancing the quiz's performance and avoiding potential technical issues.
