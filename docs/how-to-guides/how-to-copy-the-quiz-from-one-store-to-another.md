# How to Copy the Quiz from one store to another

It is possible to copy a quiz that you’ve created in the Shop Quiz app to another store. Your quiz design, qestions, tags and the resutls page will be copied. However, your products and collections won’t be copied, as they have different product IDs in your new store. 

Make sure the [Shop Quiz app](https://revenuehunt.com/product-recommendation-quiz-shopify/) is installed in both stores before proceeding with the steps below.

## Step 1: Generate Export Quiz Code

To do that, go to [Quiz Settings > General](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#general) and select “Export quiz to another store”. Once selected, a popup will appear with a unique code. Copy this code before closing the window. The code is valid for 1 hour.

*Tip: Copy the export quiz code to a text file first to make sure it's not lost.*

## Step 2: Login to the Other Store

Login to your new store and open the Shop Quiz app. 

Make sure you’re not logged into two Shopify/eCommerce accounts at the same time on the same browser. This may cause caching issues. Instead, use Incognito / Private browsing for the second account.

## Step 3: Import the Quiz

Go to the app's [Dashboard](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/dashboard/) and open the [New Quiz](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/dashboard/#new-quiz) menu. 

Select the option “import a quiz from another store” and paste the code (generated in a previous step) there.
