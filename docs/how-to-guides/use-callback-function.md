# How to Use Callback Functions for Custom Integrations

Custom integrations are essential for developers looking to enhance the functionality of their websites, especially when it comes to tailoring user experiences. One powerful tool for achieving such customization is through the use of callback functions. This guide will walk you through the process of leveraging callback functions for custom integrations, specifically within the context of a Product Recommendation Quiz. Whether you're aiming to add unique code, display bespoke product recommendations, or direct users to specific pages on your store, callback functions offer a versatile solution.

## What Are Callback Functions?

A callback function is a piece of JavaScript code that executes in response to an event - in this case, the completion of a quiz. By tapping into the quiz responses, developers can access a wealth of information including individual answers, customer tags, and recommended products. This data is delivered in a JSON format via a JavaScript Callback Function, enabling you to add it directly to your website.

## Implementing the Callback Function

1. **Initial Setup**: To begin, insert the following code into your store's theme, ideally just before the closing `</head>` tag:
   ```html
   <script>
     function prqQuizCallback(quizResponse){
       console.log(quizResponse);
     }
   </script>
   ```
    This simple example utilizes a `console.log()` function to output the JSON containing all the quiz response data. However, this is merely a starting point. Developers are encouraged to tailor the callback function to meet their specific needs.
    
2. **Example Use Cases**: Beyond merely logging the data, you might want to trigger specific actions based on the quiz outcomes. For instance, introducing a `prqAddOneToCartCallback(event);` function could be beneficial when a customer adds a product to their cart directly from the quiz results.
3. **Exploring Additional Callbacks**: There are several other callback functions you can utilize for more granular control and interaction with the quiz results. Additional callbacks handle removing products from the cart, adding all products to the cart, and acknowledging when the quiz app loads.
    - `prqSlideCallback(event);` triggers when a customer answers a quiz question.
    - `prqAddOneToCartCallback(event);` activates when a product is added to the cart.
    - `prqAddedOneToCartCallback(event);` confirms when a product has been successfully added.

## Troubleshooting

To ensure that your callback function integration is successful and operates as intended, here are some crucial checks and considerations to discuss with your developer:

1. **Verify Correct Implementation**: Ensure that the callback function has been accurately added to your main theme HTML file. This step is foundational and mistakes here could prevent the function from executing properly.
2. **Access the Results Page First**: The callback function is designed to trigger upon reaching the quiz's results page. This sequence ensures that the callback captures the quiz response, saving it as JSON in your website's local storage, before any redirection occurs. It's critical to ensure the results page is accessed to allow this process to unfold correctly.
3. **Secure Data Storage**: Confirm that the callback response is being correctly stored on your website. An effective method involves wrapping the redirection logic within the callback function itself. This ensures the data is mapped or saved before any redirection takes place. For example:
    ```javascript
    function prqQuizCallback(quizResponse) {
    // Code to map or save the data...

    // Then, redirect the user to the desired page:
    window.location.href = 'yourTargetURLHere';
    }
    ```
    Choose an appropriate storage solution for the callback response, such as cookies, local storage, or even as query parameters in the URL, depending on your specific needs and the nature of the data.


Implementing callback functions for custom integrations enables developers to significantly enhance the user experience on their websites. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can effectively tap into quiz responses, offering personalized content and interactions based on user inputs.
