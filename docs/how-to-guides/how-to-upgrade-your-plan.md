# How to Upgrade Your Pricing Plan

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to upgrade your pricing plan, choose between monthly and yearly options, manage multiple quizzes, request refunds, and find billing information.

## Upgrading Your Plan

### Steps to Upgrade

1. **Navigate to Plans & Pricing**: Go to the top right corner of your dashboard.
2. **Select Your New Plan**: Choose the plan you wish to upgrade to.
3. **Upgrade**: Click the `Upgrade` button.
4. **Complete Payment**: You will be redirected to the payment page to finalize the upgrade.

### Monthly vs Yearly Plans

- **Initial Recommendation**: Begin with a monthly plan to gauge your quiz usage.
- **Switching to Yearly**: For a reduced rate, switch to a yearly plan after establishing your usage pattern. Access this option under "Plans & Pricing" by selecting "Show Yearly."

## Managing Your Plan

### Downgrading

- **Temporary Upgrade**: If you've upgraded for a specific campaign, you can downgrade to a smaller plan based on your needs.
- **Flexibility**: We offer proportional discounts for unused portions of your plan.

### Multiple Quizzes

- **Unlimited Quizzes**: Publish as many quizzes as you like across all plans, including the Free plan. Usage is aggregated across your domain.

## Financial Considerations

### Refunds

- **Requesting a Refund**: Contact support for refund inquiries. Shopify issues automatic pro-rata refunds based on plan usage.

### Larger Plans

- **Accessing Larger Plans**: For higher volumes, view larger plans starting at $199/month for better rates per quiz completion.

### Discounts

- **Two-Year Subscription**: A 50% discount is available for upfront two-year subscriptions. Start with a monthly plan to assess results before committing.

## Plan Inclusions and Billing

### Free Plan

- **Usage-Based Pricing**: All features are free; paid plans increase monthly quiz completion limits and remove branding.

### Free 14-Day Trial

- **Trial Activation**: Automatically activated upon signup, allowing full access to paid features without a credit card.

### Paid Responses

- **Counting Responses**: Responses are counted when a user completes the quiz. Partial completions are not counted.

### Invoices and Billing Details

- **Shopify Invoices**: Charges appear on your monthly Shopify invoice.
- **Changing Billing Details**: Update directly in your Shopify store settings.

### Plan Responses Reset

- **Rolling Count**: Responses are tallied over the past 30 days, with the plan adjusting based on this rolling period.

## Example: Basic to Pro Plan Transition

- **Billing Cycle**: Independent of the 30-day measurement period, billing adapts based on usage within this rolling timeframe.
- **Surge in Responses**: Notifications are sent as you approach or exceed your plan limits, with options to upgrade as needed.
