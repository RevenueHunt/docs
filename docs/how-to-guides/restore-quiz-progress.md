## Understanding Saved Versions

=== "Shopify (Legacy)"

    Version History does not track every minor edit. Instead, it captures a new version each time you publish changes to your quiz with the top-right `Publish` button. 

    - A new version is saved only when you click `Publish` on your quiz. This action updates the preview/live quiz and records a version in the history. 
    - The interface uses colored `tags` to indicate where changes were made, such as to `questions` or `settings`, making it easier to identify the nature of each version. 
    - For better organization and clarity, you have the option to `rename` any saved version. This can help you keep track of significant changes or versions you may want to revert to later.

## Recovering a Quiz Version

    2. **Use the Three Dots Menu**: Next to the version you want to recover, click on the three dots menu `...` for options.
    3. **Recover Quiz Version**: Select to `create a new quiz from this version`. Once clicked, a new quiz copy will appear on your [Dashboard](/reference/dashboard/).
    4. **Re-publish the Quiz**: After creating the new quiz, you need to re-publish the quiz to make it live on your store, replacing the old quiz.

    !!! warning

        It is not possible to replace the current quiz with a previous version while keeping the same quiz ID. You can only create a new quiz from a previous version.

=== "Shopify"

    For recent changes, use the `undo` button `(Ctrl + Z)` to revert the last action.

    3. **Click Show More Details**: Click on `Show More Details` to view specific changes made in each version. Note that each version is created when you save the quiz. Only saved changes are shown in the version history.
    4. **Select the Version**: Select the version corresponding to the date of the changes you want to recover.
    5. **Use the Three Dots Menu**: Click on the three dots next to the version to see options: `   Create a New Quiz` or `Restore This Version`.

        - `Create a New Quiz` generates a new quiz with a new ID, while 
        - `Restore This Version` replaces the current quiz with the selected version without changing the quiz ID.


        !!! tip
