# How to Restore Quiz Progress

Accidentally losing progress or facing unintended changes made by a colleague can be frustrating. Fortunately, if you find yourself in such a situation with your quiz, there is a way to recover a previous stable version of your Shop Quiz: Product Recommendation Quiz. 

This guide will walk you through the process of using the [Version History](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#version-history) feature to recover an earlier version of your quiz, ensuring your hard work isn't lost.

## Accessing Version History

The [Version History](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#version-history) function allows you to browse through saved versions of your quiz, offering a safeguard against accidental loss or changes.

1. **Open Your Quiz**: Navigate to the quiz you're working on.
2. **Go to Quiz Settings**: Look for the [Quiz Settings](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#quiz-settings) option within the Quiz Builder.
3. **Find the Version History Tab**: Within the Quiz Settings, locate the [Version History](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/quiz-builder/#version-history) tab. Here, you'll see a list of the saved versions of your quiz.

## Understanding Saved Versions

Version History does not track every minor edit. Instead, it captures a new version each time you publish changes to your quiz with the top-right `Publish` button. 

- A new version is saved only when you click `Publish` on your quiz. This action updates the preview/live quiz and records a version in the history. 
- The interface uses colored `tags` to indicate where changes were made, such as to `questions` or `settings`, making it easier to identify the nature of each version. 
- For better organization and clarity, you have the option to `rename` any saved version. This can help you keep track of significant changes or versions you may want to revert to later.

## Recovering a Quiz Version

If you need to recover a previous version of the quiz:

1. **Select the Version**: Identify the version you want to recover from the list. Use the colored `tags` and `time stamps` as a guide to find the version with the desired changes.
2. **Use the Three Dots Menu**: Next to the version you want to recover, click on the three dots menu `...` for options.
3. **Recover Quiz Version**: Select to `create a new quiz from this version`. Once clicked, a new quiz copy will appear on your [Dashboard](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/reference/dashboard/).
