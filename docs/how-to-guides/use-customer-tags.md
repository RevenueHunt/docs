# How to Use Customer Tags to Segment Your Audience

Effective audience segmentation can dramatically improve the results of your marketing campaigns, and **customer tags** are a powerful tool for achieving this. This article will guide you through using customer tags to segment your audience, improving your marketing strategies, and ultimately growing your business the right way.

## Why Use Customer Tags?

Understanding the value of each member of your audience is crucial. While accumulating a large following on social media or a lengthy email list may seem beneficial, its true value comes into question if you know nothing about the individuals that make up those numbers.

**The Importance of Segmentation**

- **FACT 1:** Campaigns that are **highly segmented** can yield more than three times the revenue per recipient compared to unsegmented campaigns.
- **FACT 2:** Ideally, your business should earn at least $1 per month for each subscriber. If this isn't the case, it indicates that your email list isn't segmented sufficiently.

Segmentation allows for more personalized marketing strategies. By segmenting your audience based on specific criteria, you can target them more effectively with tailored content and offers.

Using quizzes is an innovative way to both provide personalized product recommendations and segment your customers. By adding customer tags into your quizzes, you can automatically send quiz results to your mailing list or CRM, enabling precise segmentation based on customer responses.

Once integrated, your CRM or mailing list will contain detailed segmented data on your customers. This enables you to create dynamic segments and direct hyper-targeted campaigns to different groups based on their quiz responses. 

For example, within Klaviyo, you can easily craft segmented campaigns or assign specific email flows to various segments, ensuring that your marketing efforts are as effective as possible.
