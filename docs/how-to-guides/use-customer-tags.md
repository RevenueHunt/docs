# How to Add and Use Customer Tags

Effective audience segmentation can dramatically improve the results of your marketing campaigns, and **customer tags** are a powerful tool for achieving this. 

This article will guide you through adding customer tags to choices, using customer tags to segment your audience, and improving your marketing strategies. 

By adding customer tags into your quizzes, you can automatically send quiz results to your mailing list or CRM, enabling precise segmentation based on customer responses.


!!! tip "Why Use Customer Tags?"

    Understanding the value of each member of your audience is crucial. While accumulating a large following on social media or a lengthy email list may seem beneficial, its true value comes into question if you know nothing about the individuals that make up those numbers.

    **The Importance of Segmentation**

    - **FACT 1:** Campaigns that are **highly segmented** can yield more than three times the revenue per recipient compared to unsegmented campaigns.
    - **FACT 2:** Ideally, your business should earn at least $1 per month for each subscriber. If this isn't the case, it indicates that your email list isn't segmented sufficiently.

    Segmentation allows for more personalized marketing strategies. By segmenting your audience based on specific criteria like specific customer tags, you can target them more effectively with tailored content and offers.

    By adding customer tags into your quizzes, you can automatically send quiz results to your mailing list or CRM, enabling precise segmentation based on customer responses.

### Creating Segments in Your CRM

=== "Shopify"

    Once integrated, your CRM or mailing list will contain detailed segmented data on your customers. This enables you to create dynamic segments and direct hyper-targeted campaigns to different groups based on their quiz responses. 

    For example, users tagged with `dry_skin` can be targeted with a campaign promoting a specific moisurizing skincare product, while users tagged with `oily_skin` can be targeted with a campaign promoting a specific cleansing product.

    Instructions on how to create segments will vary per CRM platform but in general the segment definition will be similar to the following:

    !!! example "Example of a segment definition"

        If the value of the custom property `tags` contains `dry_skin` then the customer should be included in the segment.

    Any profile that has a tag will be included in the segment automatically.

    !!! warning

        In most integrations, tags are updated with every quiz retake. If you wish to preserve tags from each quiz attempt, [contacting support](/how-to-guides/contact-customer-support/) is recommended for further assistance.
