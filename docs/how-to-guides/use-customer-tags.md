# How to Use Customer Tags to Segment Your Audience

Effective audience segmentation can dramatically enhance the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns, and customer tags are a powerful tool for achieving this. This article will guide you through using customer tags to segment your audience, enhancing your marketing strategies, and ultimately growing your business the right way.

## Why Use Customer Tags?

Understanding the value of each member of your audience is crucial. While accumulating a large following on social media or a lengthy email list may seem beneficial, its true value comes into question if you know nothing about the individuals that make up those numbers.

**The Importance of Segmentation**

- **FACT 1:** Campaigns that are highly segmented can yield more than three times the revenue per recipient compared to unsegmented campaigns.
- **FACT 2:** Ideally, your business should earn at least $1 per month for each subscriber. If this isn't the case, it indicates that your email list isn't segmented sufficiently.

Segmentation allows for more personalized marketing strategies. By segmenting your audience based on specific criteria, you can target them more effectively with tailored content and offers.


## How to Add Customer Tags to Your Quiz

Utilizing quizzes is an innovative way to both provide personalized product recommendations and segment your customers. By incorporating customer tags into your quizzes, you can automatically send quiz results to your mailing list or CRM, enabling precise segmentation based on customer responses.

1. **Open the Customer Tags tab**: Access the Quiz Builder and navigate to the "Customer Tags" section.
2. **Create new tags**:  To create a tag, start typing the name of the tag next to a choice and confirm with `enter`. Once a tag is created, it can be used to be linked to other choices.
3. **Link tags to choices**: Create new tags or use the existing ones to link them to choices in the quiz. When a customer selects a choice, all associated tags will be added to their profile.
4. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Publish` button to publish the changes and update the preview/live quiz.

### How to Send Customer Tags to CRMs

1. **Connecting Your Quiz:** Within the Quiz Builder, find the "Connect" tab. This section allows you to link your quiz with several third-party services, including Klaviyo, HubSpot, Mailchimp, Omnisend, and Shopify Customers List. Integration with additional services is possible via Zapier.

2. **Integration:** After choosing a service to connect, simply follow the provided instructions. This setup ensures that every time someone takes your quiz, their contact details, responses, and product recommendations are directly sent to your selected mailing list or CRM.

### Utilizing Segmented Data

Once integrated, your CRM or mailing list will contain detailed segmented data on your customers. This enables you to create dynamic segments and direct hyper-targeted campaigns to different groups based on their quiz responses. For instance, within Klaviyo, you can easily craft segmented campaigns or assign specific email flows to various segments, ensuring that your marketing efforts are as effective as possible.

### Advanced Tips for Shopify Users

- **Dynamic Tagging:** In Shopify, tags added to a customer profile are updated with every quiz retake. If you wish to preserve tags from each quiz attempt, contacting support is recommended for further assistance.


Customer tags offer a strategic method for segmenting your audience based on detailed criteria. By effectively applying these tags through quizzes and integrating with CRMs or mailing lists, you can significantly enhance your marketing efforts, leading to higher engagement rates and increased revenue.
