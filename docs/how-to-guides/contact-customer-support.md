## What Level of Support is Offered

We offer email support to all our users, whether they’re free or paid.

We offer live chat and videocall support to merchants on any of our paid plans. We only have a chat available for merchants using our Built for Shopify app.

### Our support team can help you with:

- Using the Quiz Builder  
- Customizing the quiz design with our built-in tools  
- Understanding the recommendation algorithm  
- Integrating the quiz with other apps  
- Interpreting quiz metrics and analytics  
- Troubleshooting why certain products are (or aren’t) recommended in the results  

We respond to every query within **2–3 hours on the same business day**. If your question needs more in-depth assistance, our team will offer to schedule a live one-on-one call.

### What we **cannot** do for you:

- Add custom behaviors with JavaScript (your developer should handle this)  
- Add custom styles with CSS (your developer should handle this)  
- Debug your WooCommerce store setup or configuration (your developer should handle this)  
- Debug issues related to your Shopify theme (your developer or the theme’s developer should handle this)  
- Create or edit Klaviyo templates (please contact a [Klaviyo template developer](https://www.fiverr.com/gigs/klaviyo-template) for this)

**Please note:** while our app lets you include custom JavaScript and CSS in your quiz, we’re a small team and can’t supply or maintain those code snippets. Any advanced customization must be handled by your developer. If you don’t have an in-house developer you can find affordable freelance developers on platforms like [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/) or [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/).
 
## Can You Build a Quiz for Me?

**No.** Our support team can help you understand how the app works, and point you to helpful support articles and videos, but we do not offer quiz-building services. 

If you need help building & styling your dream quiz, you can find affordable freelance developers on platforms like [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/) or [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/). Any front-end developer should be able to help you with queries regarding quiz building and styling. You can also search for quiz-building experts on these platforms by typing `quiz` in the search bar.
