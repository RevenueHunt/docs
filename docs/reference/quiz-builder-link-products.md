In the Link Products tab, you can link individual product varaints from your store to choices.

Once a product variant is linked to a choice and the customer picks that choice, that product variant will receive 1 vote.

To link a product to a choice click on the white dropdown bar and start typing the name.

Be careful when using exclusions. Once a product is excluded from a choice, that product will never show on the resutls page, even if it was upvoted in another choice earlier/later.

**Missing products?**  - You may need to run a [Catalog Sync]() to update the app.
