The drop-off rate is measured based on events, which are triggered whenever someone starts a quiz. Some of these start events can be blocked by adblocking plugins in browsers. If you see a difference between the number of quiz starts and the dropoff rate, that is because the number of quiz starts in the analytics tab is automatically adjusted by the algorithm to filter in also the starts blocked by the ad blocker plugin.
