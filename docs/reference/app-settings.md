## Catalogue

=== "Shopify"

    ![manual_shopifyV2_appsettings_catalogue](/images/manual_shopifyV2_appsettings_catalogue.png)

    Product names, descriptions, prices, and images shown in your quiz results are always pulled live from Shopify — they're always up to date.

    The catalogue import updates the lists of **tags, collections, vendors, variants, and metafields** available in the quiz builder. This happens automatically every 24 hours. If you've just added new tags or collections in Shopify and don't see them in the builder, use the import button below.

    **Import tags, collections, vendors & metafields** - This section shows the current import status, the number of items imported (products, collections, tags, vendors, variants, metafields), and the `Import now` button to trigger a manual import. The import history can be expanded to see past imports.

    `Import now` - Start a new catalogue import. This typically takes a few minutes depending on your catalog size.

    `Refresh` - Refresh the import status and tag/vendors/variants/metafields quantities.

    `Low inventory Filter` - This setting lets you control which products are eligible to be recommended in the quiz results based on stock levels.

    **When unchecked (default behavior):** Out-of-stock products will still appear in recommendations, but the "Add to cart" button will automatically display "Sold out" and become disabled. Customers cannot add out-of-stock variants to their cart. The "Sold out" text can be customized in [Quiz Settings > Content](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#messages-quiz-content) under **Buttons**.

    **When checked:** If you check the `Filter products by inventory level` box, the app will hide any products that are low or out of stock from quiz recommendations entirely. This prevents customers from seeing products that are unavailable to purchase. Once checked, the **`Minimum stock level`** option will become available. You can set the minimum stock level for products to be eligible for recommendations.

    !!! info "How products with multiple variants are handled"

        A product is only hidden from recommendations when **all** of its variants are below the minimum stock threshold. If a product has at least one variant above the threshold, the product remains eligible for recommendations.

    `Draft products` - this setting lets you control which products are eligible to be recommended in the quiz results based on draft status.

    `Include draft products in recommendations` - When enabled, recommendations will include products or variants that are in draft status. Draft products could be recommended and will be shown in the 'Quiz preview' and under [Responses > Analysis](/reference/quiz-builder/metrics/#response-analysis). This setting is useful if you want to build your quiz with draft products and test it before publishing them. Draft products won't be displayed in the live quiz until they're published.

    `Collection product order` - Control how products are ordered within collections for recommendations.

    `Catalogue mode` - Choose between `Default (faster imports)` and `Preserve collection order`. 
    
    `Default (faster imports)` - When products have equal votes, they appear in random order. This mode imports your catalogue faster. 
    
    `Preserve collection order` - When products have equal votes, they appear in the same order as arranged in your Shopify collections. Products placed earlier in your collection appear first in recommendations.

    !!! warning "After changing this setting"

        You must click `Import now` to apply the change. The new ordering takes effect only after a fresh import.

    ??? info "When to use Preserve collection order?"

        Enable this if you've manually arranged products in your Shopify collections (for example, best-sellers first or new arrivals at the top) and want that order reflected in quiz recommendations.

        When `Preserve collection order` is enabled products are imported in the order they appear in your Shopify collections and when two products have equal votes, the one placed earlier in the collection appears first. This works with both manual sorting and Shopify's automatic collection sorting (best-selling, alphabetical, price, etc.).

        For example: Imagine you have a "Best Sellers" collection with products arranged by sales:

        1. Product A (best seller)
        2. Product B (second best)
        3. Product C (third best)

        If Products A and C both receive 3 votes in a quiz:

        - **With Default mode**: Either could appear first (random)
        - **With Preserve collection order**: Product A appears first (position 1 beats position 3)


=== "Shopify (Legacy)"

    ![app settings catalogue](/images/manual_appsettings_catalogue.png)

    `Metafields Namespaces` - We will import the metafields information for the following namespaces. You will then be able to display this information on the product's result page. In this section, we'll display a list of metafield categories found in your store. You can toggle the button to activate the metafields.
    
    !!! tip

        Follow this article to show metafields in the quiz: [How to Add Product Metafields](/how-to-guides/add-product-metafields/).

=== "WooCommerce"

    ![manual_appsettings_catalogue_woo](/images/manual_appsettings_catalogue_woo.png)

    **What information to pull from your products** - Choose custom settings for your products within the app.

    `Short/Long description in products` - By selecting one or the other you can choose which description of your products will be shown on the results page.

    `Pass attribute information to result page` - Toggle to activate/desactivate. Once this option is active, the app will pass attributes to your results page. You need to [run a catalog sync](/how-to-guides/sync-catalog/) after activating this option. Follow this article to learn how to show these attributes on the results page once they are synced: [How to Add Product Metafields](/how-to-guides/add-product-metafields/).

    `Use attributes as categories` - Allows you to use your store's attributes to group products into categories that can be then linked to choices via the [Link Collections/Link Categories tab](/reference/quiz-builder/link-collections/).

## SMTP settings

=== "Shopify"

    ![app settings smtp](/images/manual_shopifyV2_appsettings_smtp.png)

    **SMTP Settings** 

    SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. SMTP is a connection protocol that enables third-party apps (e.g. RevenueHunt: Product Recommendation Quiz) to send emails through your email server.

    When you connect the RevenueHunt app to your SMTP Server, the follow-up emails with the quiz results that are sent to your customers won't be sent from our *no-reply@prq.email* email account, they'll be sent from your email account. 

    !!! tip

        Check [How to Send Result Emails from your own server](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails-from-custom-server/) for detailed instructions on how to set this up.

    `SMTP From` - Set what name and email the customer will see when they receive the email. The "From" field must be in format: `"Full Name" <name@company.com>`.

    `SMTP Server` - Set your server URL. The "Server" field must be in format: `smtp.example.com`.

    `SMTP Username` - Set your SMTP Username.

    `SMTP Password`  - Provide the password associated with the username.

    `SMTP Port` - Set the SMTP port (25, 465, 587 or 2525)

    `SMTP Authentication`  - Select from teh dropdown your SMTP email authentication method.

    `Enable STARTTLS` - Check to enable STARTTLS. *STARTTLS is a protocol command used to upgrade an existing insecure connection to a secure, encrypted connection using TLS (Transport Layer Security). It typically runs over port 587. You should check this if your mail server supports STARTTLS".* Note that this option is enabled by default, but you should untick it if your SMTP server does not support STARTTLS, as this could prevent successful connections.

    `Enable SSL` - Check to enable SLL. *SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is an older protocol for encrypting connections. If enabled, your connection starts as secure from the beginning (unlike STARTTLS which upgrades after connecting). This is usually used on port 465. Only enable SSL if your SMTP provider specifies SSL.* This option is enabled by default, but should be unticked for SMTP servers that don't use SSL encryption.
       
    !!! tip "Troubleshooting"

        If you see an error check your SMTP settings with the help of a third-party tool such as [Gmass](https://www.gmass.co/smtp-test) or any other SMTP test site. If your settings work as intended there, they should work on our end, too. If you're having issues, please get in touch with your developer / SMTP provider.
