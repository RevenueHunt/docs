    When you connect the RevenueHunt app to your SMTP Server, the follow-up emails with the quiz results that are sent to your customers won't be sent from our *no-reply@prq.email* email account, they'll be sent from your email account. 

    Check [How to Send Result Emails from your own server](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/how-to-guides/send-result-emails-from-custom-server/) for detailed instructions on how to set this up.

    **Name to display(From):** - Set what name and email the customer will see when they receive the email.

If you see an error check your SMTP settings with the help of a third-party tool such as [Gmass](https://www.gmass.co/smtp-test) or any other SMTP test site. If your settings work as intended there, they should work on our end, too. If you're having issues, please get in touch with your developer / SMTP provider.
