        quiz.answers.latest        // Most recent answer
        quiz.variables.scores      // Variable scores { varName: number }
        quiz.variables.highest     // Highest scoring variable reference
        quiz.progress              // { index, displayStep, totalQuestions, percentComplete }

        // Actions (methods)

        actions.previous()         // Go to previous question
        actions.overrideNext('q-skintype')  // One-shot redirect

## Dynamic Content & JavaScript Reference

=== "Shopify"

    This section provides a complete reference for dynamic content using Liquid templates and JavaScript in quiz questions.

    ### Liquid Templates

    Liquid is a templating language that allows you to display dynamic content based on quiz answers and variables. It's supported in:

    - **Heading blocks** - Personalize titles
    - **Text blocks** - Dynamic paragraphs
    - **Custom HTML blocks** - Full template control
    - **Choice labels** - Personalized answer options (HTML auto-stripped for dropdowns)

    #### The `quiz` Object

    All Liquid templates have access to the `quiz` object with the following properties:

    | Property | Type | Description |
    |----------|------|-------------|
    | `quiz.id` | string | Quiz identifier |
    | `quiz.mode` | string | Always `'question'` on question pages |
    | `quiz.currentQuestion` | object | Current question data |
    | `quiz.questions` | array | All quiz questions |
    | `quiz.results` | array | All result pages |

    #### Accessing Answers

    | Property | Description |
    |----------|-------------|
    | `quiz.answers.list` | Array of all answers in chronological order |
    | `quiz.answers.byBlock['ref']` | Answer object keyed by block reference |
    | `quiz.answers.byQuestion['ref']` | Answers grouped by question reference |
    | `quiz.answers.latest` | Most recent answer |

    Each answer object contains:

    | Property | Description |
    |----------|-------------|
    | `.value` | The answer value (string) |
    | `.blockRef` | Block reference ID |
    | `.questionRef` | Question reference ID |
    | `.choicesRefs` | Array of selected choice IDs |
    | `.isValid` | Whether answer passed validation |

    #### Variables & Scoring

    | Property | Description |
    |----------|-------------|
    | `quiz.variables.scores` | Object with variable scores `{ varName: number }` |
    | `quiz.variables.highest` | Reference of highest-scoring variable |

    #### Progress (Question Mode)

    | Property | Description |
    |----------|-------------|
    | `quiz.progress.index` | 0-based question index |
    | `quiz.progress.displayStep` | 1-based step number (for display) |
    | `quiz.progress.totalQuestions` | Total number of questions |
    | `quiz.progress.percentComplete` | Completion percentage (0-100) |
    | `quiz.progress.hasPrevious` | Can navigate back |

    #### Liquid Examples

    **Display previous answer:**
    ```liquid
    {% if quiz.answers.byBlock['qbi-name'] %}
      Hello, {{ quiz.answers.byBlock['qbi-name'].value }}!
    {% endif %}
    ```

    **Show progress:**
    ```liquid
    Question {{ quiz.progress.displayStep }} of {{ quiz.progress.totalQuestions }}
    ```

    **Conditional content based on score:**
    ```liquid
    {% assign sensitivity = quiz.variables.scores.sensitive | default: 0 %}
    {% if sensitivity > 50 %}
      Based on your answers, you have sensitive skin.
    {% endif %}
    ```

    ---

    ### JavaScript API

    Custom JavaScript code receives two parameters: `quiz` (read-only context) and `actions` (methods).

    #### Quiz Context Properties

    The `quiz` parameter contains all the data from the Liquid context above, plus:

    | Property | Description |
    |----------|-------------|
    | `quiz.metadata.responseId` | Unique response identifier |
    | `quiz.metadata.language` | Quiz language code |
    | `quiz.metadata.inBuilder` | `true` if in builder preview |

    #### Actions (Methods)

    | Method | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | `actions.next()` | Navigate to next question |
    | `actions.previous()` | Navigate to previous question |
    | `actions.overrideNext(ref)` | Redirect to specific question/result (e.g., `'q-skintype'`, `'r-results'`) |
    | `actions.setAnswer(blockRef, value)` | Set answer value |
    | `actions.setAnswers(obj)` | Batch update multiple answers |
    | `actions.clearAnswer(blockRef)` | Clear an answer |
    | `actions.removeAnswer(blockRef)` | Remove answer completely |

    #### DOM Helpers

    Since the quiz may render in a shadow DOM, use these helpers instead of `document.querySelector`:

    | Method | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | `window.quiz.querySelector(selector)` | Find element in quiz |
    | `window.quiz.querySelectorAll(selector)` | Find all matching elements |
    | `window.quiz.getElementById(id)` | Find element by ID |

    #### Global Event Handler

    ```javascript
    window.quiz.onChange = (event) => {
      // event.blockRef - Block that changed
      // event.value - New value
      // event.selectedLabel - Label of selected choice
    };
    ```

    #### JavaScript Examples

    **Conditional navigation based on score:**
    ```javascript
    if ((quiz.variables.scores.sensitive ?? 0) > 80) {
      actions.overrideNext('q-sensitive-routine');
    }
    ```

    **Update element based on answer:**
    ```javascript
    const name = quiz.answers.byBlock['qbi-name']?.value || 'Guest';
    const el = window.quiz.getElementById('greeting');
    if (el) el.textContent = `Welcome, ${name}!`;
    ```

    **Auto-advance based on selection:**
    ```javascript
    window.quiz.onChange = (event) => {
      if (event.blockRef === 'qbc-skintype' && event.selectedLabel === 'Oily') {
        actions.overrideNext('q-oily-concerns');
      }
    };
    ```

    **Batch update answers:**
    ```javascript
    const age = parseInt(quiz.answers.byBlock['qbi-age']?.value || '0');
    actions.setAnswers({
      'qbc-age-group': age < 25 ? 'young' : 'mature',
      'qbc-eligible': age >= 18 ? 'yes' : 'no'
    });
    ```
