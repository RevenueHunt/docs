        **Quick Reference:**
        ```javascript
        // Quiz context (read-only)
        quiz.currentQuestion       // Current question object
        quiz.questions             // All questions array
        quiz.answers.byBlock       // Answers keyed by block reference
        quiz.answers.latest        // Most recent answer
        quiz.variables.scores      // Variable scores { varName: number }
        quiz.variables.highest     // Highest scoring variable reference
        quiz.progress              // { index, displayStep, totalQuestions, percentComplete }

        // Actions (methods)
        actions.next()             // Go to next question
        actions.previous()         // Go to previous question
        actions.overrideNext('q-skintype')  // One-shot redirect
        actions.setAnswer('qbi-name', 'John')  // Set answer value
        actions.clearAnswer('qbi-name')        // Clear answer

        // DOM helpers (shadow DOM aware)
        window.quiz.querySelector('#my-element')
        window.quiz.getElementById('my-element')
        ```

        **Example - Conditional navigation:**
        ```javascript
        if ((quiz.variables.scores.sensitive ?? 0) > 80) {
          actions.overrideNext('q-sensitive-skin');
        }
        ```

        **Example - Update element based on answer:**
        ```javascript
        const name = quiz.answers.byBlock['qbi-name']?.value || 'Guest';
        const el = window.quiz.getElementById('greeting');
        if (el) el.textContent = `Hello, ${name}!`;

    | `quiz.metadata.inBuilder` | `true` if in builder preview |

    #### Actions (Methods)

    | Method | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | `actions.next()` | Navigate to next question |
    | `actions.previous()` | Navigate to previous question |
    | `actions.overrideNext(ref)` | Redirect to specific question/result (e.g., `'q-skintype'`, `'r-results'`) |

    #### DOM Helpers

    Since the quiz may render in a shadow DOM, use these helpers instead of `document.querySelector`:

    | Method | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | `window.quiz.querySelector(selector)` | Find element in quiz |
    | `window.quiz.querySelectorAll(selector)` | Find all matching elements |
    | `window.quiz.getElementById(id)` | Find element by ID |

    #### Global Event Handler

    ```javascript
    window.quiz.onChange = (event) => {
      // event.blockRef - Block that changed
      // event.value - New value
      // event.selectedLabel - Label of selected choice
    };
    ```

    #### JavaScript Examples

    **Conditional navigation based on score:**
    ```javascript
    if ((quiz.variables.scores.sensitive ?? 0) > 80) {
      actions.overrideNext('q-sensitive-routine');
    }
    ```

    **Update element based on answer:**
    ```javascript
    const name = quiz.answers.byBlock['qbi-name']?.value || 'Guest';
    const el = window.quiz.getElementById('greeting');
    if (el) el.textContent = `Welcome, ${name}!`;
    ```

    **Auto-advance based on selection:**
    ```javascript
    window.quiz.onChange = (event) => {
      if (event.blockRef === 'qbc-skintype' && event.selectedLabel === 'Oily') {
        actions.overrideNext('q-oily-concerns');
      }
    };
    ```

    **Batch update answers:**
    ```javascript
    const age = parseInt(quiz.answers.byBlock['qbi-age']?.value || '0');
    actions.setAnswers({
      'qbc-age-group': age < 25 ? 'young' : 'mature',
      'qbc-eligible': age >= 18 ? 'yes' : 'no'
    });
    ```
