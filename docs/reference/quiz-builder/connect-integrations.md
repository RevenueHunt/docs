    !!! info
        [Google Analytics](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) and [Meta Pixel](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/) connect directly to the property set up in your store. If you have not set up tracking for your store yet, you should do it before connecting the quiz to these services.

    `Mailing & CRM's` - Sync captured quiz leads directly to your email marketing or CRM platforms, such as [Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/) or [Omnisend](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-omnisend/). Use this data for personalized campaigns, segmentation, and automated follow-ups.
