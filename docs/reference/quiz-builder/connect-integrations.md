    `Automations` - Connect to services like [Zapier](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-zapier/) or [Webhooks](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-webhooks/) and redirect your quiz data anywhere.

    `Analytics & tracking` - Integrate with platforms like [Google Analytics](/how-to-guides/integrate-google-analytics/) and [Meta Pixel](/how-to-guides/integrate-meta-pixel/) to track quiz events, measure conversions, and understand customer behavior.

    `Mailing & CRM's` - Sync captured quiz leads directly to your email marketing or CRM platforms, such as [Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/), [Omnisend](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-omnisend/), or [Shopify Customers (Shopify Flow)](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-shopify-customers/). Use this data for personalized campaigns, segmentation, and automated follow-ups.
