        ![quiz builder conditional logic skip logic rule](/images/manual_quizbuilder_conditionallogic_skiplogicrule.png)

        In the example, if a user chooses a choice "A gift" in Question 1 "Who are you shopping for?" then Question 2 "What is your skin type?" will be skipped (it will not be shown).

    All slides that contain Skip Logic will be marked with `"skip logic"` text.

    **+** - Adds another Skip Logic rule. Adds a new OR logical rule.

    **bin** - Delete the current Skip Logic rule.

    **+ add concurrent logic** - Adds a new AND logical statement to the same rule. AND conditional statements can be tricky, as both statements have to be true for the rule to take effect. For most quizzes, using the OR rule is enough.
