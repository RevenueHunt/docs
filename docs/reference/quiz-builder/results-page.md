    ??? warning "Why the Compare-at Price May Not Show on the Results Page"

        If the **compare-at price** is missing or showing as `null` on the quiz results page, this is often due to **Shopify Markets settings**. By default, Shopify can hide compare-at prices for customers in certain regions—especially in the **European Economic Area (EEA)**—due to local pricing or legal restrictions.

        How to Fix It:

        Go to **Shopify Admin → Settings → Markets → Preferences** and ensure that compare-at prices are enabled for the relevant market (e.g., Germany or the EEA).

        // Quiz context (read-only)
        quiz.currentResult         // Current result page object
        quiz.results               // All result pages array
        quiz.answers.byBlock       // Answers keyed by block reference
        quiz.variables.scores      // Variable scores { varName: number }
        quiz.variables.highest     // Highest scoring variable reference

        // Result-specific context
        quiz.resultContext.slotItems   // Recommended products/collections
        quiz.resultContext.cartItems   // Items in cart
        quiz.resultContext.discounts   // Applied discounts

        // Actions (methods)
        actions.addAllToCart()              // Add all recommendations to cart
        actions.addToCart(variantId, qty)   // Add specific item
        actions.applyDiscountCode('CODE')   // Apply discount

        // DOM helpers (shadow DOM aware)
        window.quiz.querySelector('#my-element')

## Dynamic Content & JavaScript Reference

=== "Shopify"

    This section provides a complete reference for dynamic content using Liquid templates and JavaScript on results pages.

    ### Liquid Templates

    - **Heading blocks** - Personalized titles
    - **Text blocks** - Dynamic paragraphs
    - **Custom HTML blocks** - Full template control
    - **Slot title & description** - Personalized slot headers
    - **No recommendations message** - Personalized empty states

    #### The `quiz` Object

    All Liquid templates have access to the `quiz` object with the following properties:

    | Property | Type | Description |
    |----------|------|-------------|
    | `quiz.id` | string | Quiz identifier |
    | `quiz.mode` | string | Always `'result'` on results pages |

    | `quiz.answers.latest` | Most recent answer |

    Each answer object contains:

    | `.value` | The answer value (string) |
    | `.blockRef` | Block reference ID |
    | `.questionRef` | Question reference ID |
    | `.choicesRefs` | Array of selected choice IDs |

    #### Result Context (Results Page Only)

    | `quiz.resultContext.cartItems` | Array of items currently in cart |
    | `quiz.resultContext.discounts` | Object with `applied` array and `eligible` boolean |

    #### Liquid Examples

    **Personalized greeting:**
    ```liquid
    {% if quiz.answers.byBlock['qbi-name'] %}
      {{ quiz.answers.byBlock['qbi-name'].value }}, here are your results!
    {% else %}
      Here are your personalized results!
    {% endif %}
    ```

    **Display skin type result:**
    ```liquid
    {% if quiz.variables.highest == 'dry' %}
      <h2>Your Skin Type: Dry</h2>
      <p>Your skin needs extra hydration. We recommend products with hyaluronic acid.</p>
    {% elsif quiz.variables.highest == 'oily' %}
      <h2>Your Skin Type: Oily</h2>
      <p>Your skin produces excess oil. We recommend lightweight, mattifying products.</p>
    {% elsif quiz.variables.highest == 'combination' %}
      <h2>Your Skin Type: Combination</h2>
      <p>Your skin has both dry and oily areas. We recommend balanced formulas.</p>
    {% endif %}
    ```

    **Show score-based content:**
    ```liquid
    {% assign sensitivity = quiz.variables.scores.sensitive | default: 0 %}
    {% if sensitivity > 70 %}

        <span class="price">{{ item.priceRange.minVariantPrice.amount }}</span>
      </div>
    {% endif %}
    ```

    ---

    ### JavaScript API

    Custom JavaScript code receives two parameters: `quiz` (read-only context) and `actions` (methods).

    #### Quiz Context Properties

    The `quiz` parameter contains all the data from the Liquid context above, plus:

    | Property | Description |
    |----------|-------------|
    | `quiz.metadata.responseId` | Unique response identifier |
    | `quiz.metadata.language` | Quiz language code |
    | `quiz.metadata.inBuilder` | `true` if in builder preview |

    #### Actions (Methods)

    Results pages have additional cart-related actions:

    | Method | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | `actions.addAllToCart()` | Add all recommended items to cart (async) |
    | `actions.addToCart(variantId, qty, sellingPlanId?)` | Add specific item to cart (async) |
    | `actions.applyDiscountCode(code)` | Apply discount code (async) |
    | `actions.setAnswer(blockRef, value)` | Set answer value |
    | `actions.clearAnswer(blockRef)` | Clear an answer |

    #### DOM Helpers

    Since the quiz may render in a shadow DOM, use these helpers instead of `document.querySelector`:

    | Method | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | `window.quiz.querySelector(selector)` | Find element in quiz |
    | `window.quiz.querySelectorAll(selector)` | Find all matching elements |
    | `window.quiz.getElementById(id)` | Find element by ID |

    #### JavaScript Examples

    **Auto-add to cart for premium customers:**
    ```javascript
    if ((quiz.variables.scores.premium ?? 0) > 80) {
      await actions.addAllToCart();
    }
    ```

    **Apply discount based on cart value:**
    ```javascript
    const itemCount = Object.keys(quiz.resultContext.slotItems || {}).length;
    if (itemCount >= 3) {
      await actions.applyDiscountCode('BUNDLE20');
    }
    ```

    **Display personalized message:**
    ```javascript
    const name = quiz.answers.byBlock['qbi-name']?.value || 'there';
    const skinType = quiz.variables.highest || 'your';
    const el = window.quiz.getElementById('personalized-intro');
    if (el) {
      el.innerHTML = `<p>Hi ${name}! Based on your ${skinType} skin type, we've selected these products for you.</p>`;
    }
    ```

    **Track quiz completion with analytics:**
    ```javascript
    // Send quiz completion data to your analytics
    const data = {
      responseId: quiz.metadata.responseId,
      skinType: quiz.variables.highest,
      scores: quiz.variables.scores,
      recommendedProducts: Object.keys(quiz.resultContext.slotItems || {}).length
    };

    // Example: Send to your analytics endpoint
    fetch('/api/quiz-completed', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(data)
    });
    ```
