### SMTP

![app settings smtp](/images/manual_appsettings_smtp.png)

**SMTP Settings** 

SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. SMTP is a connection protocol which enables third-party apps (e.g. Shop Quiz) to send emails through your email server.

When you connect the Shop Quiz app to your SMTP Server, the follow-up emails with the quiz results that are sent to your customers won’t be sent from our no-reply@prq.email email account, they’ll be sent from your email account. 

Check [How to Send Result Emails from your own server]() for detailed instructions on how to set this up.

**Name to display(From):** - Set what name and email the customer will see when they recieve the email.

**SMTP Server** - Set your server URL.

**SMTP Username** - Set your SMTP Username.

**SMTP Password**  - Provide the paswsword associated with the username.

**SMTP Port** - Set the SMTP port (25, 465, 587 or 2525)
    
**test connection & activate** - Once you've provided all your credentials you can test if the connection to your SMTP server is succesful. If you see an error check your SMTP settings with the help of a third party tool such as [Gmass](https://www.gmass.co/smtp-test) or any other SMTP test site. If your settings work as intended there, they should work on our end, too. If you’re having issues, please get in touch with your developer / SMTP provider.
