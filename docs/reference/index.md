SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. SMTP is a connection protocol which enables third-party apps (e.g. Shop Quiz) to send emails through your email server.

When you connect the Shop Quiz app to your SMTP Server, the follow-up emails with the quiz results that are sent to your customers won‚Äôt be sent from our no-reply@prq.email email account, they‚Äôll be sent from your email account. 

Check [How to Send Result Emails from your own server]() for detailed instructions on how to set this up.

If you see an error check your SMTP settings with the help of a third party tool such as [Gmass](https://www.gmass.co/smtp-test) or any other SMTP test site. If your settings work as intended there, they should work on our end, too. If you‚Äôre having issues, please get in touch with your developer / SMTP provider.
