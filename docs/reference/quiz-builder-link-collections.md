## Link Collections

![quiz builder link collections](/images/manual_quizbuilder_linkcollections.png)

In the Link Collections tab, you can link entire collections of products from your store to choices. This includes Shopify collections, tags, virtual vendors, and variants collections.

Once a collection is linked to a choice and the customer picks that choice, all the products in that collection will receive 1 vote.

To link a collection to a choice click on the white dropdown bar and start typing the name.

Select a collection and it will be automatically added to the choice. 

**Moisturizers(1)** - (1) The number in the brackets indicates how many product varaints are in that collection.

You can link multiple collections to the same choice but be careful. If a product is part of two collections linked to the same choice, it will receive 2 votes from that choice (one vote from each collection linked to that choice).

To remove a linked collection click "x" next to the collection name.

**excluded collections** - Opens the dropdown which allows to exclude collections of products from a choice.

Be careful when using exclusions. Once a collection of products is excluded from a choice, the products from that collection will never show on the resutls page, even if they were upvoted in another choice earlier/later.

**Missing collections or collections show (0) products?**  - You may need to run a [Catalog Sync]() to update the app.
