# Getting Started with RevenueHunt

## What is RevenueHunt app?

The RevenueHunt app is a product recommendation and video quiz application designed to enhance the online shopping experience by guiding shoppers through tailored questions, analyzing their responses, and recommending the perfect products based on their preferences. 

This interactive tool is compatible with Shopify's official [Shop app](https://shop.app/), aiming to improve customer engagement and increase sales by collecting zero-party data and segmenting leads to grow the audience. It offers personalized product recommendations through interactive quizzes, providing tailored suggestions that match the shopper's needs and preferences. 

The app includes a Free plan and a 14-day free trial, with paid plans starting at $39 per month​.

        ??? question "What’s the difference between the WooCommerce extension and a WordPress Plugin?"

            The [WordPress Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/product-recommendation-quiz-for-ecommerce/) is free to install and puts you directly on our **Free plan**. The Free plan allows up to 100 quiz responses per month without any charges but has a “Powered by RevenueHunt” branding. If your usage exceeds the Free plan, you’ll be asked to upgrade to a Basic plan which is billed monthly.

            The [WooCommerce extension](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-recommendation-quiz-for-woocommerce/) requires a yearly subscription (29$/year) to install the app and puts you on a **Starter Plan**.
