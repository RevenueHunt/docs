# How to Convert Leads to Customers

A product recommendation quiz is more than just an engagement tool. Done right, it becomes the foundation of your **customer acquisition and retention strategy**. By capturing contact details and delivering personalized results, you can build trust, drive conversions, and turn first-time quiz takers into long-term buyers.

## Why Lead Conversion Matters

Every completed quiz gives you two things:

* **Zero-party data** — insights customers willingly share (skin type, age, goals, preferences).
* **Buying intent** — customers are already engaged and closer to purchase than cold leads.

Instead of letting this data sit idle, you should use it to **personalize follow-ups**. Sending the right product recommendations to the right person at the right time can dramatically increase sales.

## Send Result Emails Directly from the App

The simplest way to convert quiz takers is to **send results instantly**. With the 💎Built for Shopify RevenueHunt app, you can email quiz results without needing a third-party tool.

Why this works:

* Customers expect instant results after investing time in a quiz.
* Seeing personalized recommendations in their inbox builds credibility and encourages immediate action.
* You don’t need to set up external tools if you want a quick, lightweight funnel.

How to do it:

1. Add an **Email Address question block** to your quiz.
2. Go to **Quiz Settings → Emails → Respondents**.
3. Enable **Send Results Email** and customize the email template.
4. Personalize it with dynamic content such as product images, titles, and prices.

## Connect Your Quiz to a CRM or Marketing Platform

For advanced flows, connect your quiz to your CRM or ESP (Email Service Provider). The app integrates with tools like **Klaviyo, Omnisend, Mailchimp, HubSpot, and Zapier**.

Why this matters:

* You can build **multi-step post-quiz email flows**.
* Quiz answers and recommended products are synced as custom properties in your CRM.
* You can segment your audience (e.g., “dry skin + prefers vegan products”) and target them with tailored campaigns.

Best Practices for Follow-Up Email Flows

Sending results is just the first step. To maximize conversions, follow up with a structured email flow that builds trust and encourages repeat purchases.

Recommended flow for quiz-takers:

- **Results Email** (Immediately): Send the quiz results with recommended products and a clear “Shop Now” CTA.

- **Education Email** (1–2 days later): Provide usage tips, routines, or benefits of the recommended products.

- **Social Proof Email** (3–5 days later): Share testimonials, before/after photos, or customer stories.

- **Incentive Email** (5–7 days later): Offer a discount, free gift, or bundle deal to drive the purchase.

- **Retention Email** (2–3 weeks later): Recommend refills, complementary products, or subscription options.

This sequence works especially well in the beauty and supplements industries, where customer trust and education play a big role in buying decisions.

Example flow in Klaviyo:

1. **Immediately** – Send results with product images and “Shop Now” CTA.
2. **1–2 days later** – Send an educational email with tips for their skin/hair type.
3. **3–5 days later** – Share testimonials or success stories.
4. **5–7 days later** – Offer a discount code or bundle deal.
5. **2–3 weeks later** – Retarget with refills or complementary products.

## Other Tips for Converting Leads

* **Make the email optional**: Some customers prefer immediate results without sharing details. This keeps the experience frictionless while still capturing quality leads from engaged users.
* **Offer incentives**: Reward customers for completing the quiz with a discount or free gift. This boosts both lead capture and conversions.
* **Use personalization**: Address the customer by name and recall their quiz answers in follow-ups. This makes your messages feel like expert advice, not generic marketing.
* **Track performance**: Monitor open rates, click-through rates, and conversions in your ESP to refine your post-quiz funnel.
