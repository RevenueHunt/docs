Building a product selector for your eCommerce store has never been easier with our completely new `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app.

    The `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app is a new version of the app that went through a complete re-design.

    With our modern drag-and-drop builder, extensive design options, and powerful recommendation engine, you can create stunning quizzes that perfectly match your brand. We offer a variety of design and content [templates](https://revenuehunt.com/templates/) tailored specially for the beauty industry (skin care quiz, hair care quiz, lipstick match finder) and other verticals.

While creating a quiz is straightforward, ensuring it serves both your audience and your business requires some strategic thinking. At RevenueHunt, **we've analyzed countless successful product recommendation quizzes** and built our new Shopify app based on what works best. We've identified elements that make quizzes popular with online shoppers and drive results for brands.

In this article, we've gathered all this knowledge to help you build a high-converting product selector that uses the latest features of our platform.

Here‚Äôs a list of things every Product Recommendation Quiz should have (and how to add them):

## 1. Make the quiz visible

*(publish on the header, publish in multiple locations)*

You can have the most beautiful and thought-through quiz in the world but it won't be useful if your customers cannot find it. Just like a real-life shop attendant, the quiz should reach out to the customers to ask *"Is there anything I can help you with?"*. 

Our new  `üíéBuilt for Shopify` RevenueHunt app offers native integration with your store, making it easier than ever to [publish your quiz](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz/). Unlike the legacy version that used iframes, the new version embeds directly into your store's theme for better performance and seamless integration. 

!!! info "You can:"

    - Add the quiz as a native Shopify block anywhere on your pages
    - Create a floating chat-like button that follows customers as they browse
    - Set up automatic popups for new visitors
    - Embed the quiz inline with your content
    - Add quiz links to your navigation menu

Most successful quizzes are **published in multiple locations** to help customers at different stages of their shopping journey. 

!!! example "You can publish your quiz in multiple locations:"

    - A native quiz block in your homepage header showcases the quiz as a key feature
    - A floating button provides easy access as customers browse your collections
    - An automatic popup engages first-time visitors
    - Inline quizzes within relevant collection pages help customers make informed choices (e.g., a shade finder quiz in your lipstick collection)

![how to build a succesful quiz image1](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image1.png)

Ensuring that the quiz is easy to find can make a big difference in your sales conversions. Most quiz takers try the quiz a few times before completing the purchase. Make the quiz visible and you‚Äôll see the sales go up!

## 2. Match the store‚Äôs design

*(Design: match stores font and color scheme, use a background image, CSS)*

You know this already. A beautifully designed website sells better than a generic one and so does the quiz! Our new  `üíéBuilt for Shopify` app takes quiz design to the next level with a powerful visual design system.

!!! info "Quiz Design Options"

    The new [Quiz Design](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/) interface features a Shopify-like Block Editor that makes customization intuitive and powerful:

    - **Visual Block Editor**: Add, reorder, and customize blocks for questions, results, product slots, and HTML content with simple drag-and-drop
    - **Typography & Colors**: Fine-tune your fonts, colors, and button styles to match your brand perfectly
    - **Modern Templates**: Choose from our collection of professionally designed templates built specifically for Shopify
    - **Layout Control**: Adjust spacing, alignment, and layout without touching code
    - **Custom CSS/JS**: For advanced users, you still have full control through custom code

The native integration with Shopify means your quiz will inherit some of your theme's styles automatically (like your website's font), creating a matching experience. You can then customize further to make it uniquely yours. Check out these beautiful [customization examples](https://revenuehunt.com/templates/#customization) to gather inspiration for your next quiz project!

## 3. Come up with a professional name for the quiz

*(Eg. ‚ÄúShade Finder‚Äù, ‚ÄúPersonalized Skin Prescription‚Äù, ‚ÄúRoutine Builder‚Äù, ‚ÄúSkin Test‚Äù)*

Let‚Äôs talk names now. When you hear the word ‚Äòquiz‚Äô, what is the first thing that comes to mind? To most people a quiz is either a dreadful school memory or a lighthearted ‚ÄòWhich animal are you?‚Äô entertainment. The truth is, the word quiz doesn‚Äôt have the best reputation, but fortunately you don‚Äôt have to stick with it. 

Finding the right name for your quiz can sometimes be key to getting more conversions. A **‚ÄòShade finder‚Äô**, a **‚ÄòSkincare Routine builder‚Äô**, **‚ÄòSkin Diagnostic‚Äô**, **‚ÄòHair Analysis‚Äô** sound more like a professional questionnaire than entertainment, don‚Äôt they? The secret is in the name, so try to find something that fits your brand well and provides value for the customer. If you‚Äôre not sure what to choose, think about your customer‚Äôs most asked questions and start there.

## 4. Add personalized advice

*(Jump logic, Skip logic, Display logic)*

One way to make the quiz more than just a product selector is to add personalized advice based on customer answers. Our new `üíéBuilt for Shopify` app makes this easier than ever with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for conditional logic.

!!! info "Conditional Logic"

    The new visual [Conditional Logic](/how-to-guides/hide-content-with-logic/) builder lets you create complex personalization flows without any coding:

    - Design complex branching paths with an intuitive interface similar to Shopify's theme editor with our visual logic builder
    - Chose from multiple logic types:

        - **Jump Logic**: Send customers to different questions based on their answers
        - **Skip Logic**: Hide irrelevant questions automatically
        - **Display Logic**: Show/hide content blocks based on previous answers
        - **Score Logic**: Track points and create personality-based recommendations


!!! example "When can I use logic?"

    - Does your customer have dry skin? Use Jump Logic to direct them to specific questions about dry skin concerns, completely skipping the oily skin path

    - Your customer suffers from hair loss? Create a branching path with Jump Logic that explores different causes (medication, genetic conditions, lifestyle) and provides tailored product recommendations and advice

    - Want to show special content to premium customers? Use Display Logic to reveal exclusive offers based on their responses

The visual logic builder makes it easy to create an experience that feels like talking to a real expert, guiding customers to the perfect products for their needs.

![how to build a succesful quiz image4](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic.png)

The same logic can also be applied to the contents of the Results Page. A different content block can be shown to customers with dry skin and oily skin. A different advice can be given to customers with colored or natural hair. 

![how to build a succesful quiz image4](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_answers_example1.png)

The Results Page is also a great place to give additional ‚Äúhow to use‚Äù advice or even add a prediction on how their skin will improve in the months/weeks of using the product (all depending on the customer's skin type).

## 5. Use descriptive pictures to help customers decide

*(Design your own icons & add picture questions)*

It is not always easy to know whether you have dry or oily skin, whether your complexion is light or dark, what exactly your hair-color is called‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs no better way to help the customer choose than by showing them an example. 

Adding a **[Picture question](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-types)** to your Product Recommendation Quiz can be a great way to help the customer pick the right answer and help them make an educated purchasing decision. You can add real-life examples for your customers to relate to or design your own beautiful icons that will match your store‚Äôs style. A visual quiz gets more completions than a fully-text-based one, so make sure to include some images!

![how to build a succesful quiz image5](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image5.jpg)

![how to build a succesful quiz image6](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image6.jpg)

## 6. Keep it short

*(Max. 5-6 questions)*

This is probably the most important piece of advice on this list. No matter what you do, if your Product Recommendation Quiz is too long, you‚Äôll not see the desired effects. 

Our research shows that most successful quizzes have **max. 5-6 questions**. In other cases, customers typically drop out after question 8 and almost nobody gets to question 12. There‚Äôs power in simplicity! Even if your quiz has some branching, make sure that the total time they spent on the quiz is less than 1-2 minutes.

## 7. Limit the recommended products

*(1-2, or 1 for each type)*

The less choice we have, the less time we spend deciding and the higher the chance we'll buy. Our new `üíéBuilt for Shopify` app gives you powerful tools to create focused, personalized recommendations.

!!! info "Flexible Recommendation System"

    - **Dynamic Recommendations**: Products are recommended based on customer responses, using our intelligent voting system
    - **Fixed Recommendations**: Manually choose specific products for certain answer combinations
    - **Collection Recommendations**: Recommend entire collections instead of individual products - perfect for bundles, seasonal lines, or product types
    - **Recommendation Slots**: Create structured routines by assigning products to specific slots (e.g., cleanser, toner, moisturizer)

Best Practices:

- For simple products: Recommend 1-2 best-matching items
- For routines: Use slots to recommend one product per category
- For collections: Show a curated collection that matches their needs
- Use fixed recommendations for your best-sellers or when you want complete control

The key is to make the choice clear and focused. What's the point of a quiz if you end up with 10 results from which you still need to choose? Keep it simple and watch your conversion rates grow.

![how to build a succesful quiz image7](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image7.png)

## 8. Make it Personalized

*(Recall names & answers)*

Want to make the shopping experience ultra personal? RevenueHunt app lets you use the information provided by the customer and add it to various parts of the quiz. You can, for example, ask for a person‚Äôs name and recall the answer in the next question, on the Results Page or even in the follow-up email. [Information Recalls or Content Dynamic Source](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) are a powerful tool which makes your quiz look professional, while actually being very simple to implement. 

Take a look at this example of a haircare quiz:

![how to build a succesful quiz image8](/images/how_to_build_a_succesful_quiz_image8.gif)

## 9. Send results to the customer if they want

*(Email, Klaviyo, Omnisend, Mailchimp...)*

A well-structured sales funnel, with a Product Recommendation Quiz and a targeted email campaign, can lead to 50% higher conversions. A quiz can serve as an excellent lead collector. Not only are you able to get email addresses or phone numbers via the quiz, but you can also segment your audience based on their quiz answers and follow up with an email tailored to their needs. 

Think about a marketing campaign focused on people living in large urban areas, where a proper morning or evening skin routine is especially important for a clear complexion. Big brands know that a swift follow-up is crucial to maintaining the customer‚Äôs attention. 

With RevenueHunt app, you‚Äôre able to [send quiz results](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/) directly to the customer seconds after completing the quiz. You can even connect your quiz to [Klaviyo](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-klaviyo/) and send the customer a full list of results including product pictures, descriptions, discount codes or instructions for use.

While collecting emails is a very important part of a sales, some customers prefer to take time before trusting your brand with this information. Some customers will leave immediately and some just want to see the results. To ensure the quality of the leads generated by the quiz the RevenueHunt app allows you to **make the email question optional** or even give a customer a choice if they want to see it or not.

## 10. Offer a discount after completing

*(Automatic discounts)*

This one is simple but effective! You want to reward your customers for taking a minute of their time to fill in all this valuable information (for your business). Adding a [discount code](/how-to-guides/add-discount/) at the end of the quiz can be a great way to encourage shoppers to finish the purchase. RevenueHunt app syncs the discount codes you‚Äôve set up in your store and can apply them automatically to every shopping cart.

You can even add a special code to be used at checkout for the people who answer a specific question. For example, a special discount for customers who want both,a day and night routine, to be recommended.

## 11. Go Global with Shopify Markets

*(Multi-language and multi-currency support)*

Our `üíéBuilt for Shopify` app now fully integrates with Shopify Markets, making it easy to serve customers worldwide with localized experiences:

- **Multiple Languages**: Create separate quiz versions for different languages
- **Automatic Market Detection**: Show the right quiz version based on visitor location
- **Currency Adaptation**: Display prices in local currencies automatically
- **Market-Specific Content**: Customize product recommendations and advice for different regions
- **Seamless Integration**: Works naturally with your Shopify Markets configuration

!!! tip "Best Practices"

    - Create separate quizzes for your main market languages
    - Use market-specific product recommendations when needed
    - Keep quiz logic consistent across versions
    - Test your quiz in different markets to ensure a smooth experience

This powerful integration helps you create a truly global shopping experience while maintaining the personal touch that makes quizzes so effective.
