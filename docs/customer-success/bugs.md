# Known Bugs & Limitations

We‚Äôre constantly improving the RevenueHunt app. Below you‚Äôll find a list of known bugs (unresolved issues) and current limitations (expected behaviors by design).

## üêû Known Bugs

=== "Shopify"

    These are the known bugs that we are aware of and are working to fix:

    - **Words/characters index changing while writing (scrambled text)**: Sometimes, while writing on the text inputs of the quiz builder (header, title, text block‚Ä¶) the words or individual characters can ‚Äúlose‚Äù the index continuity and get scrambled.

        !!! note "Status"
            Under investigation.

    - **GA4 Tracking**: GA4 tracking is not working properly.
    
        !!! note "Status"
            Since Google transitioned from **Universal Analytics** to **GA4**, event tracking reliability has significantly decreased. The implementation code may be correct and events may fire as expected, but GA4 can still fail to read, process, or report them accurately. 
            
            If this occurs, we recommend **contacting Google Support**, as the issue is likely on their end.

    - **iPad 10th gen not scrolling properly**: Scrolling is not acting correctly on iPad10th gen (safari) navigation.

        !!! note "Status"

        !!! note "Status"
            Under investigation.

        !!! note "Status"

    - **Quiz Completion Behavior**: Closing a pop-up quiz before finishing can cause the website background to turn white, requiring a manual refresh.

        !!! note "Status"
            Likely theme/cart conflict. Under investigation.

    - **Error on Results Page**: In some cases, users encounter an error when responses are saved and they‚Äôre redirected to the results page.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Current Limitations (By Design)

=== "Shopify"

    These are not bugs but important to know:

    - **Shopify Markets Integration**: Quizzes can be assigned to different markets, but merchants must configure them manually. Automatic detection per market is not yet supported.

    - **Email Delivery via AWS SES**: Emails are one-off transactional messages triggered by quiz submissions. The app does not support newsletters or recurring campaigns.

    - **Results Precision**: Recommendation accuracy depends on how merchants configure upvotes, logic, and product slots. The app provides flexibility but doesn‚Äôt override merchant settings.
