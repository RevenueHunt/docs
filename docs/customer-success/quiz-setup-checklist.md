# Quiz Success - 📋 Setup Checklist

A step-by-step “don’t miss anything” guide before going live.

---

### **Step 1 – Plan & Name Your Quiz**

Your quiz name sets the tone and expectation. A professional, problem-solving title makes customers take it seriously and increases engagement.


☐ Define the customer problem your quiz should solve (e.g., find the right moisturizer, build a full routine)

☐ Choose a professional name that matches your brand (*Shade Finder*, *Routine Builder*, *Skin Diagnostic*)

---

### **Step 2 – Design & Branding**

A quiz that visually matches your store feels like part of your brand and builds trust. Good design boosts completion rates and conversions.

☐ Apply your **store fonts and color scheme**

☐ Add a **background image** or icons that fit your style

☐ Use the **visual block editor** to arrange quiz elements

☐ Add **custom CSS/JS** for advanced tweaks

👉 [Customize quiz design](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/)

!!! tip
    The 💎Built for Shopify version of the RevenueHunt app automatically pulls your Shopify theme’s base font. Go to Design → Theme in the quiz builder to customize colors, buttons, and spacing.

---

### **Step 3 – Build Questions**

Your questions should be short, clear, and visual when possible. Customers drop off if the quiz feels too long or confusing.

☐ Keep total length **5–6 questions** (under 2 minutes)

☐ Add **picture questions** for clarity (skin tones, hair colors, product types)

☐ Organize questions into logical paths

👉 [Question types](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-types)

!!! tip
    Add a question by clicking `+ Add question` or `+ Add block`. Choose `Picture Choice` if you want to show images/icons instead of text-only answers.

---

### **Step 4 – Add Personalization & Logic**

Personalization makes your quiz feel like a real consultation. Smart logic skips irrelevant questions and tailors advice to each customer.

☐ Use **Jump Logic** to branch into relevant paths

☐ Use **Skip Logic** to hide irrelevant questions

☐ Use **Display Logic** for showing targeted advice

☐ Add **personalized advice** on the results page (e.g., dry vs oily skin tips)

☐ Enable [Information Recalls](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) (e.g., greet by name, reuse answers)

👉 [Add conditional logic](/how-to-guides/hide-content-with-logic/)

---

### **Step 5 – Configure Recommendations**

The power of a quiz lies in guiding customers to clear choices. Too many results cause decision fatigue, while focused suggestions drive purchases.

☐ Show only **1–2 top products**, or 1 per slot (cleanser, serum, toner, etc.)

☐ Use **recommendation slots** for routines

☐ Apply **fixed recommendations** for best-sellers

☐ Use **collections** for bundles or seasonal lines

!!! tip
    In the Results Page editor, add Product Slots. Link them to choices, collections, or fixed products under the Products tab in question settings.

---

### **Step 6 – Capture Leads & Send Results**

Collecting emails turns quiz takers into long-term customers. Sending results builds trust and creates opportunities for follow-up campaigns.

☐ Add an **email question** (make it required or optional)

☐ Enable [result emails](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/)

☐ Connect to Klaviyo, Omnisend, Mailchimp, or your CRM

☐ Personalize emails with quiz answers + product recommendations

!!! tip
    Add an Email Address block to any question. Then go to Quiz Settings → Emails → Respondents to enable automated result emails or integrations.

---

### **Step 7 – Add Incentives**

Rewards encourage customers to act immediately. A discount code is a simple but effective way to boost conversions after the quiz.

☐ Create an [automatic discount code](/how-to-guides/add-discount/) for quiz finishers

☐ Add special codes for certain paths (e.g., day & night routine buyers)

---

### **Step 8 – Publish Your Quiz**

Even the best quiz won’t help if no one sees it. Make your quiz highly visible across your store to maximize engagement.

☐ Add quiz as a **Shopify block** on homepage or header

☐ Add a **floating button** for browsing visitors

☐ Set up an **automatic popup** for first-time visitors

☐ Embed inline on relevant **collection/product pages**

☐ Add quiz links to your **navigation menu**

👉 [Publish your quiz](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz/)

---

### **Step 9 – Optimize for Global Stores**

If you sell internationally, your quiz should adapt just like your store. Localization in language, currency, and products builds trust and increases sales abroad.

☐ Create separate quizzes for **different languages**

☐ Test **currency display** in Shopify Markets

☐ Adjust recommendations for **region-specific needs**

☐ Test quizzes in multiple markets to confirm smooth experience

👉 [Shopify Markets integration](/)

!!! tip
    In Markets tab of the app, assign a quiz to a specific Shopify Market. You can duplicate a quiz and translate it with Copilot for quick multi-language setup.


---

✅ Done! Your quiz is now ready to guide customers like a real store assistant — driving higher engagement, more conversions, and global reach.
