# Quiz Success - üìã Setup Checklist

A step-by-step ‚Äúdon‚Äôt miss anything‚Äù guide before going live.

!!! info
    This checklist isn‚Äôt just theory ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **blueprint for success**. We built it by analyzing our **most successful, best-converting quizzes** from merchants in the beauty and supplements industries. These stores consistently achieve higher engagement, more completed quizzes, and stronger sales results by following these steps.

Think of it as your shortcut: if you follow this setup, you‚Äôll be building your quiz on the same foundation that has already worked for dozens of high-performing brands.

---

### **Step 1 ‚Äì Plan & Name Your Quiz**

Your quiz name sets the tone and expectation. A professional, problem-solving title makes customers take it seriously and increases engagement.


‚òê Define the customer problem your quiz should solve (e.g., find the right moisturizer, build a full routine) and make a quiz map with questions and outcomes.

‚òê Choose a professional name that matches your brand (*Shade Finder*, *Routine Builder*, *Skin Diagnostic*)

??? example "Example: Professional Quiz Name"

---


### **Step 2 ‚Äì Build Questions**

Your [questions](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#question-types) should be **short, clear, and visual** when possible. Customers drop off if the quiz feels too long or confusing.

‚òê Add a **Welcome** slide that clearly sets expectations ‚Äî explain what the customer will gain from the quiz and how long it will take. Keep it visually engaging and highlight any reward for completion (e.g., a discount code or free gift).

‚òê Keep total length **5‚Äì6 questions** (under 2 minutes)

!!! warning
    We've noticed a significant drop-off in quiz completion rates when the quiz is over 6 questions-long and almost nobody makes it to question 12. Keep the quiz short and concise or it won't achieve the desired results.

‚òê Add **picture questions** for clarity and engagement (skin tones, hair colors, product types)

??? info "How to Add a Picture Question"

    Add a question by clicking `+ Add question` or `+ Add block`. Choose [Picture Choice](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#picture-choice) if you want to show images/icons instead of text-only answers.

---


### **Step 3 ‚Äì Add Personalization & Logic**

Personalization makes your quiz feel like a real consultation. [Smart logic](/how-to-guides/use-conditional-logic/) skips irrelevant questions and tailors advice to each customer.

‚òê Use [**Jump Logic**](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/) to branch into relevant paths OR [**Skip Logic**](/how-to-guides/use-skip-logic/) to hide irrelevant questions

??? example "Example: Showing different advice based on previous answers"

    ![jump logic example](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_conditionallogic.png)

    Check this article to learn how to branch the quiz based on previous answers: [How to Use Jump Logic](/how-to-guides/use-jump-logic/)


‚òê Add **personalized advice** on the results page (e.g., dry vs oily skin tips) and use [**Display Logic**](/how-to-guides/use-display-logic/) for showing targeted advice (e.g., show different advice based on skin type)

??? example "Example: Advice based on calculated skin type"

    ![display logic example](/images/how_to_shopifyv2_use_display_logic_based_on_variable_example1.png)

    Check this article to learn how to set up a quiz that determines the user's skin type and shows personalized advice and products: [How to Set Up a Winning Variable Quiz](/how-to-guides/set-up-scoring-quiz/#winning-variable-quiz)

‚òê Enable [Information Recalls](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/) (e.g., greet by name, reuse answers)

??? example "Example: Recalling information from previous questions"

    ![information recalls example](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC8-Recalls.gif)

    Check this article to learn how to recall information from previous questions: [How to Use Information Recalls](/how-to-guides/use-information-recalls/)


---

### **Step 4 ‚Äì Configure Recommendations**

The power of a quiz lies in guiding customers to clear choices. Too many results cause decision fatigue, while focused suggestions drive purchases.

‚òê Show only **1 top product**

??? example "Example: Showing one matching product"

    ![recommendations example](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC7-UNDID_Blurred.png){width="500"}

‚òê Use **recommendation slots** for routines, 1 product per slot (cleanser, serum, toner, etc.)

??? example "Example: Skincare routine recommendations"

    ![recommendations example](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/images/how_to_recommend_slots_example.png)

‚òê Apply a slot with **fixed recommendations** for best-sellers

### **Step 5 ‚Äì Design & Branding**

A quiz that visually matches your store feels like part of your brand and builds trust. Good design keeps the quiz engaging and boosts completion rates.

??? info "How to Customize Quiz Design"

    Check this article to learn how to customize the quiz design: [Customize Quiz Design](/how-to-guides/customize-quiz-design/)

    Note that the `üíéBuilt for Shopify` version of the RevenueHunt app automatically pulls your Shopify theme‚Äôs base font.

    ![quiz design example](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC1-OLAPLEX_Blurred-1024x452.png)

‚òê Apply your **store fonts and color scheme**

‚òê Add a **background image** or icons that fit your style

‚òê Use the **visual block editor** to arrange quiz elements

‚òê Add **custom CSS/JS** for advanced tweaks


---

### **Step 6 ‚Äì Capture Leads & Send Results**

Collecting emails turns quiz takers into long-term customers. Sending results builds trust and creates opportunities for follow-up campaigns.

‚òê Add an [**email question**](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#email-address) to gather leads from the quiz

??? tip "Make the email question *optional*"

    To don't hurt your quiz conversions, you can make the email question optional in [email question settings](/reference/quiz-builder/questions/#email). This way users will be able to opt-out but still can see their results.

    ![email question settings](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizbuilder_questions_blocksettings_email.png)


‚òê Enable [result emails](/how-to-guides/send-result-emails/) to send results to the quiz takers who left their email

??? info "Tutorial: Sending Emails"

    Check this video tutorial to learn how to send emails with the RevenueHunt app: [Sending Emails](/tutorials/sending-emails/)

‚òê For advanced features, [connect the quiz to your CRM](/how-to-guides/send-leads-to-crm/) (eg. Klaviyo, Omnisend, Mailchimp, Webhooks, etc.) and set up a follow-up email campaign

‚òê Personalize emails with quiz answers + product recommendations

---

### **Step 7 ‚Äì Add Incentives**

Rewards encourage customers to act immediately. A discount code is a simple but effective way to boost conversions after the quiz.

‚òê If you haven't yet, add a Welcome slide that clearly sets expectations ‚Äî explain what the customer will gain from the quiz and highlight any **reward for completion**.

‚òê If available for your platform, create and add an [automatic discount code](/how-to-guides/add-discount/) for quiz finishers

‚òê Create a discount code for quiz takers and **add the dicount code as text** to the quiz last question or results page

??? example "Example: Discount Code"

    ![discount code example](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/PIC9-discount.gif)

---

### **Step 8 ‚Äì Publish Your Quiz**

Even the best quiz won‚Äôt help if no one sees it. Make your quiz highly visible across your store to maximize engagement. Most successful quizzes are **published in multiple locations** on the website to help customers at different stages of their shopping journey.

??? tip "Is there anything I can help you with?"

    Just like a real-life shop attendant, the quiz should reach out to the customers to ask *"Is there anything I can help you with?"*.

??? info "How to Publish Your Quiz"

‚òê Add a [**banner with a button**](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-link/#link-popup-as-take-the-quiz-button) to open the quiz

‚òê Add quiz as a [**inline block**](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-inline/#embedding-an-inline-quiz-on-a-dedicated-landing-page) on dedicated landing page or homepage

‚òê Set up an [**automatic popup**](/how-to-guides/publish-quiz-automatic-popup/) for first-time visitors

---

### **Step 9 ‚Äì Optimize for Global Stores**

If you sell internationally, your quiz should adapt just like your store. Localization in language, currency, and products builds trust and increases sales abroad.

??? tip "How to Set Up a Quiz for Multiple Markets"

    In Markets tab of the app, assign a quiz to a specific Shopify Market. You can duplicate a quiz and translate it with Copilot for quick multi-language setup.

    Check this video tutorial to learn how to set up a quiz for multiple markets: [Assign Quizzes to Shopify Markets and Languages](/tutorials/shopify-markets/)

‚òê Create separate quizzes for **different languages**

‚òê Test **currency display** in Shopify Markets

‚òê Adjust recommendations for **region-specific needs**

‚òê Test quizzes in multiple markets to confirm smooth experience
