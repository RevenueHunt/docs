In this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know about transitioning to our Built for Shopify app, including the switching process, key differences between versions, and how to provide feedback to help us refine the app even further. Let’s get started!

## Transitioning to Built for Shopify: What You Need to Know

Plus, as a thank-you for being part of this exciting journey, you’ll receive a 25% lifetime discount on all plans once the Built for Shopify version is officially released.

Please note that the Built for Shopify app is a fresh start: **you’ll need to recreate your quizzes, including all questions, choices, and product or collection recommendations**. But rest assured, you can switch between the Legacy and Built for Shopify versions at any time if you need to.
