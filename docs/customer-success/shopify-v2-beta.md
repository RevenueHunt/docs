In this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know about transitioning to Version 2, including the switching process, key differences between versions, and how to provide feedback to help us refine the app even further. Let’s get started!

## Transitioning to Version 2: What You Need to Know

As a beta tester, you'll have exclusive early access to Version 2, giving you the chance to explore its enhanced capabilities while enjoying free usage during the beta phase. Plus, as a thank-you for being part of this exciting journey, you’ll receive a 25% lifetime discount on all plans once Version 2 is officially released.

Please note that Version 2 is a fresh start: **you’ll need to recreate your quizzes, including all questions, choices, and product or collection recommendations**. But rest assured, you can switch between Version 1 and Version 2 at any time if you need to.
