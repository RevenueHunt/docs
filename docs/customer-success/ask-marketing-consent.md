# Smart Ways to Ask for Marketing/Data Processing Consent in the Quiz

Marketing and data processing is crucial for building trust and ensuring compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA. For ecommerce platforms, especially those in the beauty sector, product recommendation quizzes offer a unique and engaging way to collect valuable customer data. However, asking for consent must be done thoughtfully to avoid deterring users.

Here are smart, user-friendly strategies to ask for marketing and data processing consent in your RevenueHunt Product Recommendation Quiz.

## First Consider **When** to Ask
The best way to ask for email/phone marketing consent is to make it a natural part of the quiz flow. Instead of presenting it as a standalone request, weave it into the narrative of the quiz. There are two approaches on when to ask for marketing consent and both will affect your quizzes drop-off rate/ completion rate:

### üëã Before the Quiz Begins

Start with a friendly welcome message that explains the benefits of taking the quiz. Mention that by providing consent, users will receive personalized recommendations and exclusive offers.

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent before the quiz begins](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent-start-quiz-1024x732.png)


Asking for consent before the quiz starts will lead to **lower quiz completions** and higher drop off at the beginning but will provide **more quality leads** and filter clients genuenly interested in your products. This approach is better for merchants selling unique and luxury items.

### üñêÔ∏è At the End

At a strategic point, such as before showing the results, include a consent request. Make it part of a question about communication preferences. This creates a sunk-time-cost fallaciy in the mind of the customer and they are more likely to leave their data just to see the results.

![smart ways to ask for marketing consent at the end](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/consent-end-quiz-e1718952561212-1024x702.png)

Asking for consent at the end of the quiz will lead to a **lower drop-off** at this point since the customer is already invested in the experience. This will lead to higher completion rates and eventually **higher conversions** and upselling success. This approach is better for merchants selling inexpensive items or routines.

It is not recommended to ask for email or marketing data mid-way through the quiz as this only increases your quiz drop-off rate.

## Next, if it should be **Optional** or **Mandatory**

Whether you make your email/phone number question mandatory or optional will also have a huge impact on your quiz drop-off and conversion rate.

### ‚õî Mandatory

Making the email/phone consent question mandatory ensures that you collect contact information from every user who completes the quiz. This can be beneficial for building a robust email list quickly. However, it may also deter some users from completing the quiz if they are not comfortable sharing their information.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Ensures a high volume of data collection | May increase quiz drop-off rates. May include many fake emails. |
| Filters out less engaged users, potentially leading to higher-quality leads | Some users may find it intrusive and opt-out early |


### ‚úÖ Optional

Making the email/phone consent question optional can create a more user-friendly experience, encouraging more users to complete the quiz. This approach respects user privacy and autonomy, potentially leading to higher overall quiz engagement.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Higher quiz completion rates | Lower volume of data collection |
| Users feel less pressured, leading to a more positive brand experience | May require additional incentives to encourage users to opt-in |
