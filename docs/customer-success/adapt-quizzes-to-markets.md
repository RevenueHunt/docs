# Adapt Product Quizzes for Different Markets and Languages

When a shopper lands on your store, they instantly notice two things:  

*Does this feel made for me?* and *Can I trust it?*  

![adapt quizzes to markets image1](https://revenuehunt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Quizzes-for-markets.png)

If your quiz greets a French customer in English, shows dollars instead of euros, or asks questions that feel out of place in their culture, you lose that moment of connection.  

Adapting your quizzes for different markets and languages is not just a technical detail ‚Äî it‚Äôs a way of saying **you belong here**.

## The Case for Localization

Think of your quiz as a digital salesperson.  
A good salesperson doesn‚Äôt speak the same script to everyone ‚Äî they adapt depending on who‚Äôs in front of them.

- In Spain, friendliness and warmth can make people more comfortable sharing information.  
- In Germany, clarity and compliance cues (like showing ‚Äúper 100ml‚Äù pricing) reassure customers that your brand is professional.  

    !!! tip "Tip: Product Metafields"
    
        To show the ‚Äúgrundpreis‚Äù or `per 100ml` price for cosmetic products RevenueHunt app allows you to show these values by automatically [syncing the metafields/attributes](/how-to-guides/add-product-metafields/) of products from your store.

- In the US, speed and incentives (‚ÄúTake this 45-second quiz for 10% off‚Äù) tend to drive engagement.

The same quiz, copied and pasted across all markets, misses those nuances. A localized quiz, on the other hand, feels natural ‚Äî and customers reward that effort with higher engagement and stronger conversions.

## What Changes When You Localize

Localization isn‚Äôt just swapping languages. It touches multiple layers of the experience:

**Language and tone.** A casual ‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs find your skincare match‚Äù might resonate in the US, while a more polished tone may feel appropriate in Japan.  

**Visuals.** Even colors carry meaning. Red signals good fortune in China but can imply danger in Western markets.  

**Currency and pricing.** Showing euros to a German customer instead of USD removes an instant layer of friction.  

**Legal requirements.** Some regions enforce very specific rules ‚Äî like GDPR consent in Europe or advertising standards in Canada.  

Together, these details tell your customers: *we understand you, and we built this experience for you*.

## The Business Payoff

Brands that localize their quizzes consistently see three wins:

1. **More completed quizzes.** People stick with what feels familiar and relevant.  
2. **Higher conversions.** Clear pricing and tailored recommendations reduce hesitation.  
3. **Deeper customer loyalty.** When someone feels seen, they‚Äôre far more likely to come back.

And there‚Äôs a side benefit: you gather **better data**. Localized quizzes reveal what customers in France care about versus what drives decisions in Australia. That‚Äôs market research you can act on.

## Tips for a Smooth Rollout

    If you want the technical ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù on assigning quizzes to Shopify Markets, we‚Äôve got you covered here:  
    üëâ [Tutorial: Assign Quizzes to Shopify Markets and Languages](https://docs.revenuehunt.com/tutorials/shopify-markets/)

Start small. Choose your top two or three markets, duplicate your best-performing quiz, and adapt it. Don‚Äôt try to cover the globe in one sprint.  

Keep branding consistent. Customers should recognize your brand instantly, even if the tone shifts slightly to match local expectations.  

Test in the wild. The in-app preview won‚Äôt show market differences, so you‚Äôll need to publish and actually change your store region or language to see what customers see.  

Plan for upkeep. Quizzes aren‚Äôt ‚Äúset and forget.‚Äù Product lines evolve, translations need polishing, and regulations shift. Build localization into your ongoing operations, not as a one-off project.

A localized quiz does more than recommend products. It builds trust across borders, increases conversions, and turns your store into a brand that feels truly global.  

But remember: the real success lies not in the setup, but in the mindset.   Localization is the difference between saying *we sell everywhere* and *we care everywhere*.
