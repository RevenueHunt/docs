In this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know about transitioning from the Legacy app to our Built for Shopify app, including the switching process, key differences between versions, and how to provide feedback to help us refine the app even further. Let’s get started!

!!! info "What is Built for Shopify?"

    Built for Shopify is Shopify’s highest standard for app development. BFS apps are:

    - Natively optimized for Shopify

    - Faster, more secure, and scalable

    - Seamlessly integrated with Shopify admin

    By switching to our BFS version of our RevenueHunt app, you’re upgrading to an app that performs better, works more intuitively, and is future-ready.
