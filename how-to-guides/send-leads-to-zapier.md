        ```


    ??? example "Example Tags"

        Tags are automatically generated based on quiz logic or answers:

        ```json
        "tags": ["30s", "dry_skin"]
        ```

        You can use them to segment leads or filter automations in Zapier.

    ??? example "Product Recommendations"

        If your quiz includes product recommendation logic, these are sent in the recommendationsBySlot field, grouped by result sections or slots:

        ```json
        "recommendationsBySlot": {
        "rsbs-520511f2": [
            "gid://shopify/Product/9634315436325",
            "gid://shopify/Product/9634314584357"
        ]
        }
        ```

    ??? example "Result Page Content"

        The quizâ€™s result page content is included in two sections:

        `resultSections` â†’ Organized view of all result blocks (headings, text, products, etc.)

        `resultContentByBlock`â†’ Flattened key-value pairs for each block reference

        Example:

        ```json
        "recommendationsBySlot": {
        "rsbs-520511f2": [
            "gid://shopify/Product/9634315436325",
            "gid://shopify/Product/9634314584357"
        ]
        }
        ```
