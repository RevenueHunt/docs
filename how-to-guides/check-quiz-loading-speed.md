# How to Check Quiz Loading Speed

When integrating a quiz into your online store, it's crucial to ensure it loads efficiently to maintain a smooth user experience. If you're encountering slow loading times for your quiz, the issue might not stem from the quiz itself but from other resources on your site affecting its performance. 

This guide outlines steps to diagnose and resolve quiz loading issues by optimizing the loading process.




=== "Shopify"

    **Step 1: Verify Direct Quiz Link Performance**

    First, isolate the quiz from your site's environment to determine if the issue lies within the quiz or your website.

    1. **Locate Your Quiz Link**: Find the direct URL of your quiz. This can be obtained from the `Share -> External` tab of your quiz platform. 
        - The link should look something like [https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/rkHm6Y](https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/rkHm6Y) or [https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/#quiz-rkHm6Y](https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/#quiz-rkHm6Y), where `rkHm6Y` represents your unique `quiz ID`.
    2. **Test Loading Speed**: Open the direct link in a browser to see how quickly the quiz loads independently of your site. Ideally, the quiz should load in less than one second.

    If the quiz loads quickly via the direct link, the slow loading times are likely caused by other elements on your website.

    **Step 2: Analyze Your Website's Loading Order**

    !!! info
        The new Built for Shopify version of the RevenueHunt app integrates the quiz as a native Shopify block within the Theme.

    Investigating the loading sequence of your website's resources can help identify what's slowing down the quiz when embedded in your site.

    1. **Open Developer Tools**: Right-click on your website in the browser and select `Inspect` to open the developer tools.
    2. **Review Network and Performance**: Navigate to the `Network` or `Performance` tabs to examine which resources are loading and how long each takes.

    Look for resources that significantly delay loading times, as these are likely culprits affecting the quiz's performance on your site.

    **Step 3: Optimize Your Website's Resources**

    Consult your developer to review and optimize the loading of resources on your site. This may involve compressing images, minimizing CSS and JavaScript files, and removing unnecessary plugins or widgets. 

    - **Optimize Third-Party Widgets**: Review any third-party widgets or scripts (e.g., marketing, chat tools) on your site. Ensure that they are loaded asynchronously or deferred to load after the quiz.

    - **Check Shopify Performance Reports**: Use [Shopifyâ€™s built-in tools](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/web-performance/improving-web-performance) to check for any resources that might be blocking the quiz from loading quickly.





=== "Shopify (Legacy)"

    
    **Step 1: Verify Direct Quiz Link Performance**

    First, isolate the quiz from your site's environment to determine if the issue lies within the quiz or your website.

    1. **Locate Your Quiz Link**: Find the direct URL of your quiz. This can be obtained from the `Share -> External` tab of your quiz platform. 
        - The link should look something like [https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/rkHm6Y](https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/rkHm6Y) or [https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/#quiz-rkHm6Y](https://skincarequiz.myshopify.com/#quiz-rkHm6Y), where `rkHm6Y` represents your unique `quiz ID`.
    2. **Test Loading Speed**: Open the direct link in a browser to see how quickly the quiz loads independently of your site. Ideally, the quiz should load in less than one second.

    If the quiz loads quickly via the direct link, the slow loading times are likely caused by other elements on your website.

    **Step 3: Try Direct iFrame Embedding**

    To circumvent slow loading caused by external scripts, directly embed the quiz using an iFrame.

    **Replace Embed Code**: Instead of using the standard embed code generated from the `Share` tab, which loads the quiz via a JavaScript file (embed.js), use an iFrame embed code. This allows the quiz to load independently of other scripts on your site.

    Replace this code:

    ```html
    <div class="rh-widget rh-inline" data-url="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/rkHm6Y" style="..."></div>
    ```

    With this:

    ```html
    <div class="rh-inline" data-url="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/rkHm6Y" style="..."><iframe src="https://admin.revenuehunt.com/public/quiz/rkHm6Y" id="DPIyZ" style="..."></iframe></div>
    ```

    This second block of code includes the quiz iFrame directly. This will start rendering the quiz before the embed.js code is loaded.

    Consult your developer to review and optimize the loading of resources on your site. This may involve compressing images, minimizing CSS and JavaScript files, and removing unnecessary plugins or widgets.
