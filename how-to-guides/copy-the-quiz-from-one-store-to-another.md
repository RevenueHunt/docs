# How to Copy the Quiz from One Store to Another

Transferring a quiz from one store to another with the RevenueHunt app is straightforward. This process allows you to duplicate your quiz design, questions, tags, and the results page, however, **products and collections will not be transferred** due to differing product IDs in the new store.

!!! warning
    Before you begin, ensure the [RevenueHunt app](https://revenuehunt.com/product-recommendation-quiz-shopify/) is installed on both the original and the new store.


!!! warning

    It is not possible to copy a quiz created with the legacy version of the RevenueHunt app into the new Built for Shopify version of the app.

This article will guide you through the process of copying a quiz from one store to another.

## Copying the Quiz

=== "Shopify"

    **Step 1: Generate Export Quiz Code**


    First, navigate to the quiz you wish to export:

    1. Go to [Quiz Settings > General](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/).
    2. Search for **Export quiz to another store** and click `Copy quiz code`. The button generates a unique piece of JSON code that allows you to copy the entire quiz from one store to another. It remains valid for only 1 hour.

    Ensure you're logged into the destination store:

## Changing Domains

Follow these steps if you plan to change the domain on which the RevenueHunt app is installed.

=== "Shopify"

    If you’re only changing the domain name (from `example.com` to `example-two.com`) and NOT changing the Shopify account (aka `.myshopify.com` address) the process shouldn’t disturb the RevenueHunt app and your quizzes. You can do so safely.

    If you’re changing the `.myshopify` account, then check [this guide](#how-to-copy-the-quiz-from-one-store-to-another) to copy the quiz from one store to another. After the quiz is copied, you may need to link your products to choices again, as they will have different product IDs in your new store. Make sure you’re **not** logged into two Shopify accounts at the same time on the same browser. This may cause caching issues. Instead, use Incognito / Private browsing for the second account.


=== "Shopify (Legacy)"

    If you’re only changing the domain name (from `example.com` to `example-two.com`) and NOT changing the Shopify account (aka `.myshopify.com` address) the process shouldn’t disturb the RevenueHunt app and your quizzes. You can do so safely.

    If you’re changing the `.myshopify` account, then check [this guide](#how-to-copy-the-quiz-from-one-store-to-another) to copy the quiz from one store to another. After the quiz is copied, you may need to link your products to choices again, as they will have different product IDs in your new store. Make sure you’re **not** logged into two Shopify accounts at the same time on the same browser. This may cause caching issues. Instead, use Incognito / Private browsing for the second account.

=== "WooCommerce"

    If you’re only changing the domain name (from `example.com` to `example-two.com`) and NOT changing the WordPress account the process shouldn’t disturb the RevenueHunt app and your quizzes. You can do so safely.

    When changing the domain accounts in WordPress, you’ll have to copy your quiz from the old domain to the new one first. [This article](#how-to-copy-the-quiz-from-one-store-to-another) explains how to do that. You may need to link your products to choices again, as they will have different product IDs in your new store. Make sure you’re **not** logged into two WordPress accounts at the same time on the same browser. This may cause caching issues. Instead, use Incognito / Private browsing for the second account.

=== "Magento"

    If you’re only changing the domain name (from `example.com` to `example-two.com`) and NOT changing the WordPress account the process shouldn’t disturb the RevenueHunt app and your quizzes. You can do so safely.

    When changing the domain accounts in Magento, you’ll have to copy your quiz from the old domain to the new one first.

=== "BigCommerce"

    If you’re only changing the domain name (from `example.com` to `example-two.com`) and NOT changing the WordPress account the process shouldn’t disturb the RevenueHunt app and your quizzes. You can do so safely.

    When changing the domain accounts in BigCommerce, you’ll have to copy your quiz from the old domain to the new one first. [This article](#how-to-copy-the-quiz-from-one-store-to-another) explains how to do that. You may need to link your products to choices again, as they will have different product IDs in your new store. Make sure you’re **not** logged into two BigCommerce accounts at the same time on the same browser. This may cause caching issues. Instead, use Incognito / Private browsing for the second account.

=== "Standalone"

    Standalone solution is independent of your domain and can be used on multiple domains simultaneously. Make sure to change your product links in your in-app [Catalogue](/reference/dashboard/#__tabbed_3_5) or Google Product Feed.

If you have any issues or doubts about changing domains, please [contact support](/how-to-guides/contact-customer-support/).
