    To start, make sure you have [Shopify Markets](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/international/managing) enabled and cofigured in your Shopify store. In order to show a quiz in a differnt currency or language, you first need to have a market configured in your Shopify store for these currencies or languages.

    !!! example "Example"
        If you have a market configured for Europe with the `EUR` currency, you can show a quiz in that market. 
        
        If you have a market configured for the US with the `USD` currency, you can show a quiz in that market.

        If you have a market in Spanish with the `ES` language, you can show a quiz in Spanish for that market.

        If you market in France with the `FR` language, you can show a quiz in French for that market.



=== "Shopify (Legacy)"


    !!! note "Platform Availability"

    The quiz doesn't have an automatic translstaion option, so you will have to transalte all the questions and answers manually. The text of buttons and admin messages can be translated in the [Quiz Settings > Quiz Content](/reference/quiz-builder/quiz-settings/#messages-quiz-content) section.  
    
    ![manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizsettings_quizcontent](/images/manual_shopifyV2_quizbuilder_quizsettings_quizcontent.png)

    In there, you can also change format of how the price currency on recommended product is displayed. If you don't change the default, the price will be displayed as set up in your Shopify Market.
