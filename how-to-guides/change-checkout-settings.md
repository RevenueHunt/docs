    1. **Access Results Page Settings**: Begin by navigating to the [Results Page](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/) tab in the [Quiz Builder](/reference/quiz-builder/). Here, you will find a clog icon indicating the [Results Page settings](/reference/quiz-builder/results-page/). Click this icon to proceed.

    2. **Locate Checkout Settings**: Within the settings menu, navigate to the `Basic` section, and from there, find the `Checkout Settings`.

    3. This is where you can customize how products are added to the cart and how customers proceed to checkout. RevenueHunt's Product Recommendation Quiz offers two primary options for managing how customers interact with products they wish to purchase:

        1. **Add Product to Cart**:

            ![how to change checkout settings add to cart](/images/how_to_change_checkout_settings_add_to_cart.png)

            - This option allows you to add selected products directly to the customer's shopping cart. It streamlines the buying process, making it easier for customers to proceed to checkout.
            - After enabling this option, you can further specify whether customers should:
                -  `proceed to cart` and be directed to the shopping cart page to review their selections or if they should
                - `proceed to checkout` and be taken directly to the checkout page, bypassing the cart. 
                    
            This decision should align with your sales strategy and consideration of the customer's convenience.

        2. **Link to Product**:

            ![how to change checkout settings view product](/images/how_to_change_checkout_settings_view_product.png)

            - Alternatively, you might want customers to have the opportunity to view more details about a product before making a purchase. Selecting this option replaces the direct 'add to cart' action with a `view product` link.
            - When customers click on the `view product` link, they are taken to the individual product page instead of adding the item directly to their cart. This can be beneficial for providing customers with additional product information, images, and reviews that might influence their purchasing decision.

        3. **Publish the changes**: Click the top-right `Publish` button to update the preview/live quiz.

            - After enabling this option, you can further specify what URL customers should be sent to in the **Cart URL**:
                -  `/cart` and be directed to the shopping cart page to review their selections or if they should
                - `/checkout` and be taken directly to the checkout page, bypassing the cart.
