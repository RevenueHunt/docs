    !!! warning 

        You cannot just upload any data source file to the RevenueHunt app. The file must be a **valid Google Product Feed XML file**. Check this [guide](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/12631822?hl=en) to learn more about the best practices for creating a valid Google Product Feed.
    

    !!! info "How do I find my Google Product Feed URL?"

        To find your Google Product Feed URL in Google Merchant Center:

        1. Log into your account at [https://merchants.google.com/](https://merchants.google.com/)
        2. Click `Products`, then `Manage product sources`.
        3. Click the name of your desired data source to open the data source settings.
        4. Under `Data source setup` check the `File URL` field and copy the URL.
        5. Paste the URL into the `File URL` field in the RevenueHunt app.
        6. Click `Save` to save the changes.

    !!! tip "Host the file somewhere public"

        Alternatively, you can also host your XML file somewhere public. For example:

        - Shopify (if your store is on Shopify): Go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Files` in your Shopify admin. Upload `google_product_feed.xml`. Copy the URL Shopify gives you (it will look like `https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/.../google_product_feed.xml`).

        - Your own website / hosting: Upload the file via FTP, cPanel File Manager, or your CMS‚Äôs media upload.

        - Cloud storage: Use Dropbox, Google Drive (with direct link), or Amazon S3 ‚Äî but make sure the link is public and ends with `.xml`.

2. Once the link is added, the app will automatically upload products and collections to your quiz account.


    !!! warning "Your Google Product Feed doesn't work?"

        First, make sure that your file is a valid Google Product Feed XML file. Review the Google [Documentation](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/12631822?hl=en) guide.

        You should also try [this validation service](https://developers.google.com/product-review-feeds/validation/) to check for problems.
